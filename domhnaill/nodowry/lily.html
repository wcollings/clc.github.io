  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I just came down from lovers' well some pleasure for to find
   <br/>
   A handsome girl from Michigan so pleasing to my mind
   <br/>
   With rosy cheeks and sparkling eyes this arrow's pierced my breast
   <br/>
   And they called her handsome Mary, the lily of the west
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I courted her for many's a day, her love I chanced to gain
   <br/>
   But too soon she slighted me which caused me grief and pain
   <br/>
   She stole away my liberty and deprived me of my rest
   <br/>
   And they called her handsome Mary, the lily of the west
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   As I roved out one evening down by the riverside
   <br/>
   I spied a lord of a high degree conversing to my bride
   <br/>
   He sang a song so merrily whilst I was sore oppressed
   <br/>
   And he sang to handsome Mary, the lily of the west
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I rushed up to my rival, a dagger in my hand
   <br/>
   I tore her from his arms and boldly did him stab
   <br/>
   Being mad with desperation my dagger pierced his breast
   <br/>
   And I was betrayed by Mary, the lily of the west
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
