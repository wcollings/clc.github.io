  <p align="center">
   Ye muses assist me, there is none can resist me
   <br/>
   Only that fair one whom I do adore
   <br/>
   And the more that they tease me, he's the young man can please me
   <br/>
   He'll be my green wood laddie 'til time is no more
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   If you'd seen my dearest whose eyes shine the clearest
   <br/>
   His cheeks like the red blood that's new dropped in snow
   <br/>
   He is neat, tall and handsome, and his hands, warm and tender
   <br/>
   He'll be my green wood laddie whom I'd always adore
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   My parents, my darling, they slight you with scorn
   <br/>
   Because you have no riches wrapped up in store
   <br/>
   And the more that they slight you, the more I'll entice you
   <br/>
   To be my green wood laddie 'til time is no more
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And it's down in yonder bower I spent many's the long hours
   <br/>
   A-plucking wild flowers by yon clear winding shore
   <br/>
   It was his stolen kisses caused my fondest wishes
   <br/>
   He'll be my green wood laddie whom I'll always adore
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And if I had the wealth of the East or West Indies
   <br/>
   Or if I had the gold of the African shore
   <br/>
   Or if I could gain thousands I would lie in your bosom
   <br/>
   You'd be my green wood laddie whom I'd always adore
  </p>
