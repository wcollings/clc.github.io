  <p align="center">
   If I was King of Ireland with all things at my will
   <br/>
   I'd roam for recreation, new comfort to find still
   <br/>
   But the comfort I would like the best, as you will understand
   <br/>
   Oh would be to gain that lovely maid, the flower of sweet Strabane
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Her cheeks were like the roses red, her hair of lovely brown
   <br/>
   And o'er her milk-white shoulders, hair ringlets hanging down
   <br/>
   She's one of the fairest creatures of the whole Milesian Clan
   <br/>
   Sure my heart is fairly captured by the flower of sweet Strabane
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But since I cannot win you, love, no joy there is for me
   <br/>
   I will seek forgetfulness in the land across the sea
   <br/>
   Unless you chance to follow me, I'll swear by my right hand
   <br/>
   MacDonald's face you never will see, fair flower of sweet Strabane
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I wished I had my darling way down in Inisowen
   <br/>
   Or in a lonesome valley in the wild woods of Tyrone
   <br/>
   I would do my whole endeavour, I would work my newest plan
   <br/>
   For to gain you, lovely Martha, the flower of sweet Strabane
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I've often been in Phoenix Park and then Killarney fair
   <br/>
   Likewise in bonny Scotland and the winding banks of Ayr
   <br/>
   But yet, in all my travels, I never met with one
   <br/>
   That I could compare with Martha, the flower of sweet Strabane
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Farewell bonny Lifford and to Mourne's Waterside
   <br/>
   I'm sailing for America, whichever may betide
   <br/>
   Our ship is bound for Liverpool straight by the Isle of Man
   <br/>
   So farewell my dearest Martha, the flower of sweet Strabane
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
