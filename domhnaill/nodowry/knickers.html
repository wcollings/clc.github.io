  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I'm a decent, married woman, my name is Mrs. Magee
   <br/>
   I'm a native of this County Down convenient to Donaghadee
   <br/>
   I had a faithful husband oh whom I liked so fine
   <br/>
   But now he's gone and left me, and I'm nearly out of my mind
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   He wears a pair of laceless shoes, knickers of corduroy
   <br/>
   He's a swallowtail coat and waistcoat, he's only got one eye
   <br/>
   His hair and whiskers both are black, he wears a castor hat
   <br/>
   And can anyone kindly tell me, have they seen my darling Pat?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh the morning that we parted the tears rolled in his eye
   <br/>
   Saying, "Biddy dear, I'm going away my fortune for to try
   <br/>
   They say the harvest is pretty good in Scotland this year
   <br/>
   So Biddy dear, I'll send you the price of a pint, don't you be feared"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh if I can find a postbox as soon as I arrive
   <br/>
   You may expect a letter as sure as I'm alive
   <br/>
   But my Pat's away three months today and he's left me in a stew
   <br/>
   Since I lost my darling husband, oh what am I to do?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
 </body>
