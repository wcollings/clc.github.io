  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Here is to all true lovers
   <br/>
   And to mine wherever she may be
   <br/>
   This very night I shall go and see her
   <br/>
   Although she is away many miles from me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Away, away I can stay no longer
   <br/>
   The sweet Boyne water I'll have to cross
   <br/>
   And over high hills I'll roam with pleasure
   <br/>
   One night to be with my own true love
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And if this night was as dark as dungeon
   <br/>
   And not a star, love, oh to appear
   <br/>
   I would be guided without a stumble
   <br/>
   Up to the harbor where dwells my dear
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And when I came to my true love's window
   <br/>
   I stooped down low all on a stone
   <br/>
   And through a pane I did whisper slowly
   <br/>
   "Are you awake, love? Are you at home?"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Then she arose from her soft, down pillow
   <br/>
   And soon uncovered her snow-white breast
   <br/>
   Saying, "Who is there at my bedroom window
   <br/>
   Disturbing me from my long night's rest?"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "'Tis I, 'tis I, your own true love Willy
   <br/>
   Why don't you rise, love, and let me in?
   <br/>
   For I am tired of my long night's journey
   <br/>
   Besides, love, I am wet to the skin"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Then she rose up in a great hurry
   <br/>
   And soon unlocked the door she done
   <br/>
   And there they lay in each other's arms
   <br/>
   Wishing the daylight would never shine in
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh daylight, daylight is now approaching
   <br/>
   Yon dreary mountain I'll have to climb
   <br/>
   And I will climb it without a stumble
   <br/>
   Leaving the arms of my own true love
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Oh you may go and ask your father
   <br/>
   And if he's willing, my sweet bride you'll be
   <br/>
   Oh was he says, return and tell me
   <br/>
   For this is the last night I'll trouble thee"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "I may not go for to ask my father
   <br/>
   For he is sitting in his lordly air
   <br/>
   And in his right hand he holds a letter
   <br/>
   Which reads the most part of your career"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Oh you may go then and ask your mother
   <br/>
   And if she's willing, my sweet bride you'll be
   <br/>
   Oh what she says, return and tell me
   <br/>
   For this is the last night I'll trouble thee"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "I may not go for to ask my mother
   <br/>
   For signs of sweethearts she can't endure
   <br/>
   So you may go and try some other
   <br/>
   For this is the last night I'll trouble thee"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He pulled out a silver dagger
   <br/>
   And stuck it in through his snow-white breast
   <br/>
   Saying, "Aye, adieu to my parents
   <br/>
   And to the young girl that I love best
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh lay me down in yon green valley
   <br/>
   Put a marble stone at my head and feet
   <br/>
   And lay my true love right down beside me
   <br/>
   Adieu, dear parents, for me don't weep"
  </p>
