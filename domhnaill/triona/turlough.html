   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    Wild are thy hills, O'Donegal, that frowning, darkly rise
    <br/>
    As if to greet the mist that falls upon them from the skies
    <br/>
    Dark, dark thy hills, and darker still thy mountain torrents flow
    <br/>
    But none so dark as Maolmuire's heart in his castle hall at Doe
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    Fair are thy plains, O'Donegal, and calm thy winding streams
    <br/>
    That gently flow by hut and hall beneath the bright sunbeams
    <br/>
    But plain or stream or meadow green or flower upon the lea
    <br/>
    Were not more mild than Maolmuire's child, so sweet and fair was she
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    Stout grow thy oak, O'Donegal, and straight thy ashen tree
    <br/>
    And swift and straight thy sons so tall, her country's pride to see
    <br/>
    But oak or ash or young men all that spring from Irish soil
    <br/>
    Were not more stout, swift, straight and strong than the chief of Clan O'Boyle
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    He was the pride of Faughter side from the hills of Ballymore
    <br/>
    For feats of strength, none equalled him from Fanad to Gaoth Dobhair
    <br/>
    And he would go through the frost and snow on a merry Christmas Day
    <br/>
    With ringing cheer to hunt the deer from his haunts in dark Glenveagh
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    In his little boat O'Boyle would float, a-fishing he would go
    <br/>
    With hook and line to Lackagh stream that runs by castle Doe
    <br/>
    High in the castle tower his loved one lay confined
    <br/>
    And on it's lofty battlements in sorrow deep she pined
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    At the castle strand two boats lay manned to wait the rising tide
    <br/>
    Maolmuire there in chief command right cowardly did hide
    <br/>
    And when O'Boyle his homeward course steered by the Bishop's Isle
    <br/>
    They were waylaid and a prisoner made of fearless young O'Boyle
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    They brought him to the castle, in strong irons he was bound
    <br/>
    And by Maolmuire was confined to a dungeon underground
    <br/>
    But in a few days after inside the graveyard wall
    <br/>
    Four stalwart ruffians bore a bier wrapped in a funeral pall
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    Poor Aileen in her tower above beheld the mournful scene
    <br/>
    In mute amaze she cast a gaze upon the graveyard green
    <br/>
    All pale and death beside a mound of freshly risen soil
    <br/>
    The pall removed, she there beheld the features of O'Boyle
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    Then with a shriek, she madly leapt from the tower to the ground
    <br/>
    Where by her faithful waiting maid her corpse in cold was found
    <br/>
    And in Doe castle graveyard green beneath the moldering soil
    <br/>
    Maolmuire's daughter sleeps in death with Turlough Óg O'Boyle
   </font>
  </p>
