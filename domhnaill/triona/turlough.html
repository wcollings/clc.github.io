<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua"><b><u>Lyrics</u>:</b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
Wild are thy hills, O'Donegal, that frowning, darkly rise<br>
As if to greet the mist that falls upon them from the skies<br>
Dark, dark thy hills, and darker still thy mountain torrents flow<br>
But none so dark as Maolmuire's heart in his castle hall at Doe</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
Fair are thy plains, O'Donegal, and calm thy winding streams<br>
That gently flow by hut and hall beneath the bright sunbeams<br>
But plain or stream or meadow green or flower upon the lea<br>
Were not more mild than Maolmuire's child, so sweet and fair was she</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
Stout grow thy oak, O'Donegal, and straight thy ashen tree<br>
And swift and straight thy sons so tall, her country's pride to see<br>
But oak or ash or young men all that spring from Irish soil<br>
Were not more stout, swift, straight and strong than the chief of Clan O'Boyle</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
He was the pride of Faughter side from the hills of Ballymore<br>
For feats of strength, none equalled him from Fanad to Gaoth Dobhair<br>
And he would go through the frost and snow on a merry Christmas Day<br>
With ringing cheer to hunt the deer from his haunts in dark Glenveagh</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
In his little boat O'Boyle would float, a-fishing he would go<br>
With hook and line to Lackagh stream that runs by castle Doe<br>
High in the castle tower his loved one lay confined<br>
And on it's lofty battlements in sorrow deep she pined</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
At the castle strand two boats lay manned to wait the rising tide<br>
Maolmuire there in chief command right cowardly did hide<br>
And when O'Boyle his homeward course steered by the Bishop's Isle<br>
They were waylaid and a prisoner made of fearless young O'Boyle</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
They brought him to the castle, in strong irons he was bound<br>
And by Maolmuire was confined to a dungeon underground<br>
But in a few days after inside the graveyard wall<br>
Four stalwart ruffians bore a bier wrapped in a funeral pall</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
Poor Aileen in her tower above beheld the mournful scene<br>
In mute amaze she cast a gaze upon the graveyard green<br>
All pale and death beside a mound of freshly risen soil<br>
The pall removed, she there beheld the features of O'Boyle</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
Then with a shriek, she madly leapt from the tower to the ground<br>
Where by her faithful waiting maid her corpse in cold was found<br>
And in Doe castle graveyard green beneath the moldering soil<br>
Maolmuire's daughter sleeps in death with Turlough Óg O'Boyle</font></p></body>
