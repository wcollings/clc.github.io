  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Wild are thy hills, O'Donegal, that frowning, darkly rise
   <br/>
   As if to greet the mist that falls upon them from the skies
   <br/>
   Dark, dark thy hills, and darker still thy mountain torrents flow
   <br/>
   But none so dark as Maolmuire's heart in his castle hall at Doe
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Fair are thy plains, O'Donegal, and calm thy winding streams
   <br/>
   That gently flow by hut and hall beneath the bright sunbeams
   <br/>
   But plain or stream or meadow green or flower upon the lea
   <br/>
   Were not more mild than Maolmuire's child, so sweet and fair was she
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Stout grow thy oak, O'Donegal, and straight thy ashen tree
   <br/>
   And swift and straight thy sons so tall, her country's pride to see
   <br/>
   But oak or ash or young men all that spring from Irish soil
   <br/>
   Were not more stout, swift, straight and strong than the chief of Clan O'Boyle
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He was the pride of Faughter side from the hills of Ballymore
   <br/>
   For feats of strength, none equalled him from Fanad to Gaoth Dobhair
   <br/>
   And he would go through the frost and snow on a merry Christmas Day
   <br/>
   With ringing cheer to hunt the deer from his haunts in dark Glenveagh
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   In his little boat O'Boyle would float, a-fishing he would go
   <br/>
   With hook and line to Lackagh stream that runs by castle Doe
   <br/>
   High in the castle tower his loved one lay confined
   <br/>
   And on it's lofty battlements in sorrow deep she pined
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   At the castle strand two boats lay manned to wait the rising tide
   <br/>
   Maolmuire there in chief command right cowardly did hide
   <br/>
   And when O'Boyle his homeward course steered by the Bishop's Isle
   <br/>
   They were waylaid and a prisoner made of fearless young O'Boyle
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   They brought him to the castle, in strong irons he was bound
   <br/>
   And by Maolmuire was confined to a dungeon underground
   <br/>
   But in a few days after inside the graveyard wall
   <br/>
   Four stalwart ruffians bore a bier wrapped in a funeral pall
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Poor Aileen in her tower above beheld the mournful scene
   <br/>
   In mute amaze she cast a gaze upon the graveyard green
   <br/>
   All pale and death beside a mound of freshly risen soil
   <br/>
   The pall removed, she there beheld the features of O'Boyle
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Then with a shriek, she madly leapt from the tower to the ground
   <br/>
   Where by her faithful waiting maid her corpse in cold was found
   <br/>
   And in Doe castle graveyard green beneath the moldering soil
   <br/>
   Maolmuire's daughter sleeps in death with Turlough Óg O'Boyle
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
