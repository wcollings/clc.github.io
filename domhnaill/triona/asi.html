   As I roved out from the County Cavan for to view the green banks of sweet Lough Ree
   <br/>
   I fell a-courting and some fair one, she appeared to me like the queen of May
   <br/>
   I kindly asked her if she would marry or if she'd be a soldier's wife
   <br/>
   "Oh no, kind sir, I would rather tarry, for I've always chosen a single life"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "My fairest creature with pride of nature, why do you differ from all female kind?
   <br/>
   And you're a fair one, both tall and handsome, sure it's to marry you should incline"
   <br/>
   "Sure it's to marry I now shall tell you, I have promised this five years or more
   <br/>
   To one O'Reilly from the County Cavan, which oft times grieves my poor heart full sore"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Sure it's in the morning when I can't see you, my heart keeps on bleeding through the whole day
   <br/>
   And it's in the evening when I can't get near you, those who are bound, love, they must obey
   <br/>
   But if I had you in Phoenix Island, one thousand miles from my native shore
   <br/>
   Or in some low valley where no one would hear us, I would entice you to be my own"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "But you won't have me in Phoenix Island, one thousand miles from my native shore
   <br/>
   But you can sail away into where you came from, for I'll wait on Reilly forevermore"
   <br/>
   "You're like the swan, love, that swims the ocean, just making motion with both her wings
   <br/>
   And your snow-white breast, it'll be a potion to any lord or to any king
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But youth and folly makes young men marry, and silly notions makes no delay
   <br/>
   But what can't be cured must be endured, so fare thee well, darling, I must now away"
  </p>
