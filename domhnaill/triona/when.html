   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    When I was a fair maid about seventeen
    <br/>
    I listed in the navy, for to serve the Queen
    <br/>
    I listed in the navy, a sailor lad to stand
    <br/>
    For to hear the cannons rattle and the music so grand
    <br/>
    And the music so grand, and the music so grand
    <br/>
    For to hear the cannons rattle and the music so grand
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    Well, the officer that listed me was a tall and handsome man
    <br/>
    He said, "You'll make a sailor, so come along, my man"
    <br/>
    My waist being tall and slender, my fingers long and thin
    <br/>
    Oh the very soon they learned me, I soon exceeded them
    <br/>
    I soon exceeded them, I soon exceeded them
    <br/>
    Oh the very soon they learned me, I soon exceeded them
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    Well, they sent me to bed and they sent me to bunk
    <br/>
    To lie with a sailor, I never was afraid
    <br/>
    But taking off my blue coat, it oft times made me smile
    <br/>
    For to think I was a sailor and a maiden all the while
    <br/>
    And a maiden all the while, and a maiden all the while
    <br/>
    For to think I was a sailor and a maiden all the while
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    Well, they sent me off to London for to guard the Tower
    <br/>
    And I'm sure I might be there 'til my very dying hour
    <br/>
    But a lady fell in love with me, I told her I was a maid
    <br/>
    Oh she went unto the captain and my secret she betrayed
    <br/>
    My secret she betrayed, my secret she betrayed
    <br/>
    Oh she went unto the captain and my secret she betrayed
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    Well, the captain, he came up to me and he asked if this was so
    <br/>
    Oh I dare not, I dare not, I dare not say no
    <br/>
    "It's a pity we should lose you, such a sailor lad you made
    <br/>
    It's a pity we should lose you, such a handsome young maid
    <br/>
    A handsome young maid, a handsome young maid
    <br/>
    It's a pity we should lose you, such a handsome young maid"
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    So it's fare thee well, captain, you've been so kind to me
    <br/>
    And likewise, my shipmates, I'm sorry to part with thee
    <br/>
    But if ever the navy needs a lad, a sailor I'll remain
    <br/>
    I'll put out my hat and feathers and I'll run the rigging again
    <br/>
    And I'll run the rigging again, I'll run the rigging again
    <br/>
    I'll put out my hat and feathers and I'll run the rigging again
   </font>
  </p>
