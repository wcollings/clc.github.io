<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
When I was a fair maid about seventeen<br>
I listed in the navy, for to serve the Queen<br>
I listed in the navy, a sailor lad to stand<br>
For to hear the cannons rattle and the music so grand<br>
And the music so grand, and the music so grand<br>
For to hear the cannons rattle and the music so grand</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
Well, the officer that listed me was a tall and handsome man<br>
He said, "You'll make a sailor, so come along, my man"<br>
My waist being tall and slender, my fingers long and thin<br>
Oh the very soon they learned me, I soon exceeded them<br>
I soon exceeded them, I soon exceeded them<br>
Oh the very soon they learned me, I soon exceeded them</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
Well, they sent me to bed and they sent me to bunk<br>
To lie with a sailor, I never was afraid<br>
But taking off my blue coat, it oft times made me smile<br>
For to think I was a sailor and a maiden all the while<br>
And a maiden all the while, and a maiden all the while<br>
For to think I was a sailor and a maiden all the while</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
Well, they sent me off to London for to guard the Tower<br>
And I'm sure I might be there 'til my very dying hour<br>
But a lady fell in love with me, I told her I was a maid<br>
Oh she went unto the captain and my secret she betrayed<br>
My secret she betrayed, my secret she betrayed<br>
Oh she went unto the captain and my secret she betrayed</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
Well, the captain, he came up to me and he asked if this was so<br>
Oh I dare not, I dare not, I dare not say no<br>
"It's a pity we should lose you, such a sailor lad you made<br>
It's a pity we should lose you, such a handsome young maid<br>
A handsome young maid, a handsome young maid<br>
It's a pity we should lose you, such a handsome young maid"</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
So it's fare thee well, captain, you've been so kind to me<br>
And likewise, my shipmates, I'm sorry to part with thee<br>
But if ever the navy needs a lad, a sailor I'll remain<br>
I'll put out my hat and feathers and I'll run the rigging again<br>
And I'll run the rigging again, I'll run the rigging again<br>
I'll put out my hat and feathers and I'll run the rigging again</font></p></body>
