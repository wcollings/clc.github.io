  <p align="center">
   When I was a fair maid about seventeen
   <br/>
   I listed in the navy, for to serve the Queen
   <br/>
   I listed in the navy, a sailor lad to stand
   <br/>
   For to hear the cannons rattle and the music so grand
   <br/>
   And the music so grand, and the music so grand
   <br/>
   For to hear the cannons rattle and the music so grand
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, the officer that listed me was a tall and handsome man
   <br/>
   He said, "You'll make a sailor, so come along, my man"
   <br/>
   My waist being tall and slender, my fingers long and thin
   <br/>
   Oh the very soon they learned me, I soon exceeded them
   <br/>
   I soon exceeded them, I soon exceeded them
   <br/>
   Oh the very soon they learned me, I soon exceeded them
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, they sent me to bed and they sent me to bunk
   <br/>
   To lie with a sailor, I never was afraid
   <br/>
   But taking off my blue coat, it oft times made me smile
   <br/>
   For to think I was a sailor and a maiden all the while
   <br/>
   And a maiden all the while, and a maiden all the while
   <br/>
   For to think I was a sailor and a maiden all the while
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, they sent me off to London for to guard the Tower
   <br/>
   And I'm sure I might be there 'til my very dying hour
   <br/>
   But a lady fell in love with me, I told her I was a maid
   <br/>
   Oh she went unto the captain and my secret she betrayed
   <br/>
   My secret she betrayed, my secret she betrayed
   <br/>
   Oh she went unto the captain and my secret she betrayed
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, the captain, he came up to me and he asked if this was so
   <br/>
   Oh I dare not, I dare not, I dare not say no
   <br/>
   "It's a pity we should lose you, such a sailor lad you made
   <br/>
   It's a pity we should lose you, such a handsome young maid
   <br/>
   A handsome young maid, a handsome young maid
   <br/>
   It's a pity we should lose you, such a handsome young maid"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So it's fare thee well, captain, you've been so kind to me
   <br/>
   And likewise, my shipmates, I'm sorry to part with thee
   <br/>
   But if ever the navy needs a lad, a sailor I'll remain
   <br/>
   I'll put out my hat and feathers and I'll run the rigging again
   <br/>
   And I'll run the rigging again, I'll run the rigging again
   <br/>
   I'll put out my hat and feathers and I'll run the rigging again
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
