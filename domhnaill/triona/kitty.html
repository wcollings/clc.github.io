<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
Oh when I was young and full of fun like many's a dashing blade<br>
My own delight from morn to night was to court a comely maid<br>
I'd walk with her and talk with her as thousands have done before<br>
Oh but it's little I knew she would prove untrue, wee Kitty from Ballinamore</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
Young Kitty was tall and handsome and gentle as a dove<br>
Ten times a day she used to say with me she was in love<br>
Oh when she'd say this, I'd have a kiss, I would love her more and more<br>
For without a lie I would then die for Kitty from Ballinamore</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
Oh it was her parents I must blame to leave her in such a state<br>
Although I was poor, they couldn't endure for to court their daughter, Kate<br>
Although I loved her dearly and told them o'er and o'er<br>
For without a lie I would then die for Kitty from Ballinamore</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
"Well indeed, my love," says Kitty, "I'd rather be a soldier's wife<br>
To dress myself in man's attire, go fight for all of my life"<br>
So the very next day he sailed away and joined the foreign force<br>
For without a lie he would then die for Kitty from Ballinamore</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
But I was not very long listed when a letter I did receive<br>
And when I read the answer I thought I'd get some ease<br>
But the very first line that I did read, it grieved my heart full sore<br>
For young Kitty was wed to a farmer's son in the town of Ballinamore</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
So come all you pretty, fair, young men, a warning take by me<br>
Don't fall in love with every wee girl that you see<br>
For they'll tell you this and they'll tell you that and they'll do like they done before<br>
They will curl their hair and leave you there like Kitty from Ballinamore</font></p></body>
