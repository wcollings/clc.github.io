   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    Oh when I was young and full of fun like many's a dashing blade
    <br/>
    My own delight from morn to night was to court a comely maid
    <br/>
    I'd walk with her and talk with her as thousands have done before
    <br/>
    Oh but it's little I knew she would prove untrue, wee Kitty from Ballinamore
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    Young Kitty was tall and handsome and gentle as a dove
    <br/>
    Ten times a day she used to say with me she was in love
    <br/>
    Oh when she'd say this, I'd have a kiss, I would love her more and more
    <br/>
    For without a lie I would then die for Kitty from Ballinamore
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    Oh it was her parents I must blame to leave her in such a state
    <br/>
    Although I was poor, they couldn't endure for to court their daughter, Kate
    <br/>
    Although I loved her dearly and told them o'er and o'er
    <br/>
    For without a lie I would then die for Kitty from Ballinamore
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    "Well indeed, my love," says Kitty, "I'd rather be a soldier's wife
    <br/>
    To dress myself in man's attire, go fight for all of my life"
    <br/>
    So the very next day he sailed away and joined the foreign force
    <br/>
    For without a lie he would then die for Kitty from Ballinamore
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    But I was not very long listed when a letter I did receive
    <br/>
    And when I read the answer I thought I'd get some ease
    <br/>
    But the very first line that I did read, it grieved my heart full sore
    <br/>
    For young Kitty was wed to a farmer's son in the town of Ballinamore
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    So come all you pretty, fair, young men, a warning take by me
    <br/>
    Don't fall in love with every wee girl that you see
    <br/>
    For they'll tell you this and they'll tell you that and they'll do like they done before
    <br/>
    They will curl their hair and leave you there like Kitty from Ballinamore
   </font>
