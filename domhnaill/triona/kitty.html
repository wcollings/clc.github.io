  <p align="center">
   Oh when I was young and full of fun like many's a dashing blade
   <br/>
   My own delight from morn to night was to court a comely maid
   <br/>
   I'd walk with her and talk with her as thousands have done before
   <br/>
   Oh but it's little I knew she would prove untrue, wee Kitty from Ballinamore
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Young Kitty was tall and handsome and gentle as a dove
   <br/>
   Ten times a day she used to say with me she was in love
   <br/>
   Oh when she'd say this, I'd have a kiss, I would love her more and more
   <br/>
   For without a lie I would then die for Kitty from Ballinamore
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh it was her parents I must blame to leave her in such a state
   <br/>
   Although I was poor, they couldn't endure for to court their daughter, Kate
   <br/>
   Although I loved her dearly and told them o'er and o'er
   <br/>
   For without a lie I would then die for Kitty from Ballinamore
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Well indeed, my love," says Kitty, "I'd rather be a soldier's wife
   <br/>
   To dress myself in man's attire, go fight for all of my life"
   <br/>
   So the very next day he sailed away and joined the foreign force
   <br/>
   For without a lie he would then die for Kitty from Ballinamore
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But I was not very long listed when a letter I did receive
   <br/>
   And when I read the answer I thought I'd get some ease
   <br/>
   But the very first line that I did read, it grieved my heart full sore
   <br/>
   For young Kitty was wed to a farmer's son in the town of Ballinamore
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So come all you pretty, fair, young men, a warning take by me
   <br/>
   Don't fall in love with every wee girl that you see
   <br/>
   For they'll tell you this and they'll tell you that and they'll do like they done before
   <br/>
   They will curl their hair and leave you there like Kitty from Ballinamore
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
