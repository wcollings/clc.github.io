  <p align="center">
   Lately last night I was asked to a wedding
   <br/>
   A wedding of a fair maid that proved to be unkind
   <br/>
   When first she thought on her new intended lover
   <br/>
   The thoughts of her old love still ran through her mind
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Supper was over and everything ended
   <br/>
   And every young man was to sing a fine song
   <br/>
   'Til it came to the turn of her new intended lover
   <br/>
   The thoughts of her old love still ran through her mind
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh many's the one has been seven years parted
   <br/>
   Seven years away, love, that proved to be unkind
   <br/>
   But I have only been two years away, love
   <br/>
   Two years away, love, that proved to be unkind
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh how can you sit at another man's table?
   <br/>
   Or how can you drink of another man's wine?
   <br/>
   Or how can you lie in the arms of another
   <br/>
   When it's many the night you have laid in mine?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The bride, she was seated at the head of the table
   <br/>
   She knew very well to whom those words belonged
   <br/>
   Her heart, it grew faint, she could stand it no longer
   <br/>
   It was down at the feet of the bridegroom she fell
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh grant me one favor, one favor I ask you
   <br/>
   Oh grant me one favor, one favor of mine
   <br/>
   One night for to lie in the arms of another
   <br/>
   And the rest of my life for to lie in thine
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You ask for a favor that cannot be granted
   <br/>
   For you __ this, my lassie, in time
   <br/>
   For I can see quite clearly your poor heart is breaking
   <br/>
   And all for the sake of this foreign young man
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So sighing and sobbing she went from the table
   <br/>
   And sighing and sobbing she went to her bed
   <br/>
   But early next morn when the bridegroom awakened
   <br/>
   He turned to his true love found that she was dead
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh Annie, lovely Annie, I knew you never loved me
   <br/>
   For my love and your love could never agree
   <br/>
   My own, I have taken you from one you loved better
   <br/>
   My own, I have taken you, the bark from the tree
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So it's now I'll put on my suits of deep mourning
   <br/>
   Suits of deep mourning, I'll wear two and three
   <br/>
   And it's then I'll put on my own wedding garment
   <br/>
   And I'll try not to go between the bark and the tree
  </p>
 </body>
