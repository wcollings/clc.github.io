  <p align="center">
   Christmas comes but once a year
   <br/>
   And the green leaves, they are fallen
   <br/>
   Young Edmund on his pillow lay
   <br/>
   For love of Barbara Allen
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He sent his servants out one day
   <br/>
   To the place where she was dwelling
   <br/>
   My master wants one word with you
   <br/>
   If your name be Barbara Allen
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   One word from me he never will get
   <br/>
   Nor any young man breathing
   <br/>
   One word from me he never will get
   <br/>
   If his heart was fairly breaking
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Rise up, rise up," her father did say
   <br/>
   "Rise up and go and see him"
   <br/>
   Oh father, oh father, do you mind the day
   <br/>
   When you were going to shoot him?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Rise up, rise up," her mother did say
   <br/>
   "Rise up and go and see him"
   <br/>
   Oh mother, oh mother, do you mind the day
   <br/>
   When you told me for to shun him?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So slowly, slowly she got up
   <br/>
   And slowly she puts on her
   <br/>
   And slowly to his bedside
   <br/>
   Saying, "Young man, you are dying"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I'm lying low and very, very ill
   <br/>
   And the grave shall be my dwelling
   <br/>
   One kiss from you would cure me now
   <br/>
   My bonny Barbara Allen
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   One kiss from me you never will get
   <br/>
   Nor any young man breathing
   <br/>
   One kiss from me you never will get
   <br/>
   If your heart was fairly breaking
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Look up, look up at my bed head
   <br/>
   And there you will see it lying
   <br/>
   A golden basin full of tears
   <br/>
   Being shed for Barbara Allen
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Look up, look up at my bed head
   <br/>
   And there you will see it hanging
   <br/>
   My gold watch and my silver chain
   <br/>
   Bestow to Barbara Allen
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He turned his pale face to the wall
   <br/>
   And death came to him creeping
   <br/>
   Farewell, farewell to my friends all
   <br/>
   And be kind to Barbara Allen
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh she looked east and she looked west
   <br/>
   And she heard the small birds singing
   <br/>
   They sang so sweet and seemed to say
   <br/>
   Hard-hearted Barbara Allen
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   As she went on the highway home
   <br/>
   She spied his corpse a-coming
   <br/>
   Lay down, lay down that corpse in clay
   <br/>
   That I may look upon him
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   As she went up her father's lane
   <br/>
   She heard the death bells knelling
   <br/>
   And every jolt that death bell gave
   <br/>
   It was woe to Barbara Allen
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh mother, oh mother, go dig my grave
   <br/>
   Go dig it long and narrow
   <br/>
   My young man died for me today
   <br/>
   And for him I'll die tomorrow
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   One was buried in St. Mary's churchyard
   <br/>
   The other in St. Peter's
   <br/>
   Out of her grave there grew a red rose
   <br/>
   And out of his a briar
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   They grew high, so very, very high
   <br/>
   'Til they could go no higher
   <br/>
   They met at the top in a true lover's knot
   <br/>
   And it's there they'll remain forever
  </p>
