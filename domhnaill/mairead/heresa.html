   Kind friends and companions, come join me in rhyme
   <br/>
   Come, lift up your voices in chorus with mine
   <br/>
   Let's drink and be merry, all grief to refrain
   <br/>
   For we may and might never all meet here again
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus (after each verse)
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   So here's a health to the company and one to my lass
   <br/>
   Let's drink and be merry, all out of one glass
   <br/>
   Let's drink and be merry, all grief to refrain
   <br/>
   For we may and might never all meet here again
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So here's a health to the wee lass that I love so well
   <br/>
   For her style and her beauty, there's none can excel
   <br/>
   She smiles on my countenance as she sits on my knee
   <br/>
   Sure there's no one on earth is as happy as me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Our ship lies at harbor, she's ready to dock
   <br/>
   I wish her safe landing without any shock
   <br/>
   And if ever I meet you by land or by sea
   <br/>
   I will always remember your kindness to me
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
