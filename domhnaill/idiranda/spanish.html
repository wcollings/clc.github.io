  <p align="center">
   As I was walking through Dublin City
   <br/>
   About the hour of twelve at night
   <br/>
   It was there I saw a fair pretty female
   <br/>
   Washing her feet by candlelight
   <br/>
   First she washed them, then she dried them
   <br/>
   Over a fire of ambery coals
   <br/>
   And in all my life I never did see
   <br/>
   A maid so neat about the soles
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   She had twenty eighteen sixteen fourteen
   <br/>
   Twelve ten eight six four two none
   <br/>
   She had nineteen seventeen fifteen thirteen
   <br/>
   Eleven nine seven five three and one
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I stopped to look but the watchman passed
   <br/>
   Says he, "Young fellow, now the night is late
   <br/>
   And along with you home or I will wrestle you
   <br/>
   Straight away to the Bridewell gate
   <br/>
   I got a look from the Spanish lady
   <br/>
   Hot as a fire of ambery coals
   <br/>
   And in all my life I never did see
   <br/>
   A maid so neat about the soles
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   As I walked back through Dublin City
   <br/>
   As the dawn of day was o'er
   <br/>
   Oh whom should I spy but the Spanish lady
   <br/>
   When I was weary and footsore
   <br/>
   She had a heart so filled with loving
   <br/>
   And her love she longed to share
   <br/>
   And in all my life I never did meet
   <br/>
   A maid who had so much to spare
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I have wandered north and I've wandered south
   <br/>
   By Stoneybatter and Patrick's Close
   <br/>
   And up and around by the Gloucester Diamond
   <br/>
   Back by Napper Tandy's house
   <br/>
   Old age has laid her hand upon me
   <br/>
   Cold as a fire of ashey coals
   <br/>
   And gone is the lovely Spanish lady
   <br/>
   Neat and sweet about the soles
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   'Round and around goes the wheel of fortune
   <br/>
   Where it rests now wearies me
   <br/>
   Oh fair young maids are so deceiving
   <br/>
   Sad experience teaches me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
 </body>
