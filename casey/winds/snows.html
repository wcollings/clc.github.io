  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The snows, they melt the soonest when the winds begin to sing
   <br/>
   The corn, it ripens fastest as the frosts are settling in
   <br/>
   And when a young man tells me that my face he'll soon forget
   <br/>
   Before we part, I'll wage a bet he'll be fain to follow it yet
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The snows, they melt the soonest when the winds begin to sing
   <br/>
   The swallow flies without a thought as long as it is spring
   <br/>
   When springtime goes and winter blows, my lad, and you'll be fain
   <br/>
   With all your pride to follow me across the stormy main
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The snows, they melt the soonest when the winds begin to sing
   <br/>
   The bee that flew in summertime, in winter it will not sting
   <br/>
   Seen a woman's anger melt between the night and morn
   <br/>
   It's surely not a harder thing to melt a woman's scorn
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So never bid me farewell, for no farewell I'll receive
   <br/>
   You will lie with me, my love, and kiss and take your leave
   <br/>
   I'll wait here 'til the woodcock calls, and the marten takes its wing
   <br/>
   For the snows, they melt the soonest when the winds begin to sing
  </p>
