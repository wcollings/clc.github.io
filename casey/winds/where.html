    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Where are you tonight, I wonder?
   <br/>
   Where will you be tonight when I cry?
   <br/>
   Will sleep for you come easy
   <br/>
   Whilst I alone can't slumber?
   <br/>
   Will you welcome the morning
   <br/>
   At another man's side?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   How easy for you the years have slipped under
   <br/>
   And left me with a shadow the sun can't dispel
   <br/>
   For I built for you a tower full of love and admiration
   <br/>
   But I built it so high I could not reach it myself
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The view from my window is a world full of sadness
   <br/>
   The face in my mirror is the one face I know
   <br/>
   You have taken all that's in me, so my heart is in no danger
   <br/>
   Oh my heart is in no danger, but I'd still like to know
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There is a silence and it cannot be broken
   <br/>
   There is a pure heart, it's there I will go
   <br/>
   Time will work its healing, and my spirit will grow stronger
   <br/>
   But in the meantime, I would still like to know
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
