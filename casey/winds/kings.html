  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh my love has left me with bairnes twa
   <br/>
   And that's the last of him I ever saw
   <br/>
   He joined the army and marched to war
   <br/>
   He took the shilling, he took the shilling and he's off to war
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Come, laddies, come, hear the cannon roar
   <br/>
   Take the king's shilling and you're off to war
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, did he look as he marched along
   <br/>
   With his kilt and sporran and his musket gun?
   <br/>
   The ladies tipped him as he marched along
   <br/>
   He sailed out by, he sailed out by the Broomielaw
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Pipes did play as he marched along
   <br/>
   And the soldiers sang out a battle song
   <br/>
   "March on, march on," cried the captain gay
   <br/>
   For king and country, for king and country we will fight today
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, the battle rattled to the sound of guns
   <br/>
   And the bayonets flashed in the morning sun
   <br/>
   The drums did beat and the cannon roared
   <br/>
   And the shilling didn't seem, oh the shilling didn't seem much worth the war
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, the men they fought and the men did fall
   <br/>
   Cut down by bayonet and musket ball
   <br/>
   Many of these brave young men
   <br/>
   Would never fight for, would never fight for the king again
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Come, laddies, come, hear the cannon roar
   <br/>
   Take the king's shilling and you'll die in war...
  </p>
