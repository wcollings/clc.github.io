   'Twas the year of '93
   <br/>
   The French did plant an olive tree
   <br/>
   The symbol of great liberty
   <br/>
   And the people danced around it
   <br/>
   Oh wasn't I telling you
   <br/>
   The French declared courageously
   <br/>
   That equality, freedom and fraternity
   <br/>
   Would be the cry of every nation
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   In '94 a new campaign
   <br/>
   The tools of darkness did maintain
   <br/>
   Gall's brave sons, they did form a league
   <br/>
   And their foes, they were dumbfounded
   <br/>
   They gave to Flanders liberty
   <br/>
   And all its people they set free
   <br/>
   The Dutch and Austrians home did flee
   <br/>
   And the dukes they were confounded
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Behold, may all of humankind
   <br/>
   Emancipated with the French combine
   <br/>
   May laurels green all on them shine
   <br/>
   And their sons and daughters long wear them
   <br/>
   May every tyrant shake with dread
   <br/>
   And tremble for their guilty head
   <br/>
   May the fleur-de-lis in dust be laid
   <br/>
   And they no longer wear them
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   For church and state in close embrace
   <br/>
   Is the burden of the human race
   <br/>
   And the people tell you to your face
   <br/>
   That you will long repent it
   <br/>
   For kings in power and preaching drones
   <br/>
   Are the cause of all your heavy groans
   <br/>
   Down from your pulpits, down from your thrones
   <br/>
   You will tumble unlamented
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh wasn't I telling you
   <br/>
   The French declared courageously
   <br/>
   That equality, freedom and fraternity
   <br/>
   Would be the cry of every nation
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
