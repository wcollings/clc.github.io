  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Four and twenty Highland men
   <br/>
   Came from the Carron side
   <br/>
   To steal away Eppie Morrie
   <br/>
   'Cause she wouldn't be a bride, a bride
   <br/>
   Wouldn't be a bride
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Out it came her mother then
   <br/>
   It was a moonlit night
   <br/>
   She couldn't see her daughter
   <br/>
   For the moon, it shone so bright, so bright
   <br/>
   The moon, it shone so bright
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   They've taken Eppie Morrie
   <br/>
   And a horse they've bound her on
   <br/>
   And they're away to Carron side
   <br/>
   As fast as horse could gang, could gang
   <br/>
   Fast as horse could gang
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And Willie's taken his pistol out
   <br/>
   And put it to the minister's breast
   <br/>
   Oh marry me, marry me, minister
   <br/>
   Or else I'll be your priest, your priest
   <br/>
   Else I'll be your priest
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Haud away from me, Willie
   <br/>
   Haud away from me
   <br/>
   There's not a man in all Strathdon
   <br/>
   Wedded be by me, by me
   <br/>
   Wedded be by me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Then mass was sung and bells were rung
   <br/>
   And they're away to bed
   <br/>
   And Willie and Eppie Morrie
   <br/>
   Oh in one bed they were laid, were laid
   <br/>
   One bed they were laid
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He's taken the shirt from off his back
   <br/>
   And kicked away his shoes
   <br/>
   And thrown away the chamber key
   <br/>
   And naked he lay down, lay down
   <br/>
   Naked he lay down
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He kissed her on the lily breast
   <br/>
   And held her shoulders twa
   <br/>
   But aye, she gat and aye, she spat
   <br/>
   And turned to the wa', the wa'
   <br/>
   Turned to the wa'
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   They wrestled there all through the night
   <br/>
   Before the break of day
   <br/>
   But aye, she gat and aye, she spat
   <br/>
   And he could not stretch her spey
   <br/>
   Could not stretch her spey
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Early in the morning
   <br/>
   Before the light of day
   <br/>
   In came the maid of Scallater
   <br/>
   In gown and shirt alone, alone
   <br/>
   Gown and shirt alone
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Get up, get up, young woman
   <br/>
   And take a drink with me
   <br/>
   You might have called me a maiden
   <br/>
   I'm as whole as thee, as thee
   <br/>
   I'm as whole as thee
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Then came young Breadalbane
   <br/>
   With a pistol on his side
   <br/>
   Oh come away, Eppie Morrie
   <br/>
   And I'll make you my bride, my bride
   <br/>
   Make you my bride
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Go get me a horse, Willie
   <br/>
   And get it like a man
   <br/>
   And send me back to my mother
   <br/>
   A maiden as I came, I came
   <br/>
   A maiden as I came
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus 2x)
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
