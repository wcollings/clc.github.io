  <p align="center">
   Where have you been all along summer's day?
   <br/>
   Son, tell it unto me
   <br/>
   A-fishing and a-fowling in the fields and in the forest
   <br/>
   Weary mother, let me be
   <br/>
   Weary mother, let me be
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Who put the blood on your right shoulder?
   <br/>
   Son, tell it unto me
   <br/>
   It's the blood of a hare that I killed yesterday
   <br/>
   I killed most manfully
   <br/>
   I killed most manfully
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The blood of a hare, it would never be so red
   <br/>
   Son, tell it unto me
   <br/>
   It's the blood of a boy that I killed yesterday
   <br/>
   I killed most manfully
   <br/>
   Oh I killed most manfully
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   What was between yourself and the boy?
   <br/>
   Son, tell it unto me
   <br/>
   'Twas mostly the cutting down of a rod
   <br/>
   That never would come to a tree
   <br/>
   Oh it never would come to a tree
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   What will you do when your daddy finds out?
   <br/>
   Son, tell it unto me
   <br/>
   I will put my foot on board of a ship and sail away
   <br/>
   Sail to a foreign country
   <br/>
   Sail to a foreign country
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   What will you do with your lovely wedded wife?
   <br/>
   Son, tell it unto me
   <br/>
   She can put her foot on board of a ship and follow me
   <br/>
   Follow after me
   <br/>
   Follow after me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   What will you do with your two fine babes?
   <br/>
   Son, tell it unto me
   <br/>
   I'll give one to my father and the other to my mother
   <br/>
   To keep them company
   <br/>
   Oh to keep them company
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   What will you do with your house and your lands?
   <br/>
   Son, tell it unto me
   <br/>
   I will lay them bare to the birds and the air
   <br/>
   There's no more welcome for me
   <br/>
   Oh there's no more welcome for me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   What will you do in the winter of your life?
   <br/>
   Son, tell it unto me
   <br/>
   Like a sally in the rock, I will bend in the wind
   <br/>
   And pray for the gods' mercy
   <br/>
   Oh and pray for the gods' mercy...
  </p>
