  </p>
  <p align="center">
   One evening of late as I carelessly strayed
   <br/>
   I espied a fair maid in deep mourn
   <br/>
   I asked her the matter, she quickly made answer
   <br/>
   I am weary from lying alone, alone
   <br/>
   I am weary from lying alone
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   My comely young damsel, come down here alongside me
   <br/>
   And tell me of the years that have a-flown
   <br/>
   For seven long gone and eleven years around
   <br/>
   I am weary from lying alone, alone
   <br/>
   I am weary from lying alone
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   If I got a comely young man who would take me without fortune
   <br/>
   And make me a wife of his very own
   <br/>
   For the truth is, I'll say is, I'll die in despair
   <br/>
   If I lie any longer alone, alone
   <br/>
   If I lie any longer alone
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There's a neat sweet li'l flower in this garden alongside me
   <br/>
   Take it away, sure it is all but your own
   <br/>
   For the flower, it will fade and so also will the maid
   <br/>
   For she's weary from lying alone, alone
   <br/>
   For she's weary from lying alone
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
