   </b>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   This world is made with sweat and toil
   <br/>
   Pushing muscle and elbow oil
   <br/>
   We can't lie too long in the shade
   <br/>
   'Cause everyday must be remade
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Some days we fall, some days we fly
   <br/>
   In the end we all must die
   <br/>
   Our rotten flesh and broken bones
   <br/>
   Will feed the ground that we call home
   <br/>
   Will feed the ground that we call home
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   A new sprout grows from a fallen tree
   <br/>
   This song will go on after me
   <br/>
   So lift your heart and dry your eyes
   <br/>
   It's another day to live and die
   <br/>
   Another day to live and die
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I've run naked in the wild
   <br/>
   Seen the beauty of a new born child
   <br/>
   Like the alchemists of old
   <br/>
   I've tried to spin my straw to gold
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Most times a giver, sometimes a thief
   <br/>
   So full of hope but prone to grief
   <br/>
   And between freedom and despair
   <br/>
   I know the truth is lying there
   <br/>
   I know the truth is lying there
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Go on now, don't you worry about me
   <br/>
   You've miles to go and a world to see
   <br/>
   My life's been long and full and good
   <br/>
   I've run this race the best I could
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It's a short time here and a long apart
   <br/>
   The same song rings in both our hearts
   <br/>
   So take this guitar when I'm gone
   <br/>
   Write your rhymes and pass it on
   <br/>
   Write your rhymes and pass it on
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   A new sprout grows from a fallen tree
   <br/>
   This song will go on after me
   <br/>
   So lift your heart and dry your eyes
   <br/>
   It's another day to live and die
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
