   :
   <br/>
   I'm a four loom weaver as many a man knows
   <br/>
   Nowt to eat and I've worn out my clothes
   <br/>
   Clogs are both broken and stockings I've none
   <br/>
   Hardly give me tuppence for all I've got on
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Old Billy at Bent, he kept telling me long
   <br/>
   We might have better times if I'd but held my tongue
   <br/>
   I holded my tongue 'til I near lost my breath
   <br/>
   And I feel in my heart that I'll soon starve to death
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We held out for six weeks, thought each day was the last
   <br/>
   We tarried and shifted 'til now we're quite fast
   <br/>
   We lived upon nettles when nettles were good
   <br/>
   Waterloo Porridge was best of our food
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Our Margaret declares if she'd clothes to put on
   <br/>
   She'd go up to London and see the great man
   <br/>
   Things didn't alter when there she had been
   <br/>
   She swears she'll fight with blood up to thine
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I'm a four loom weaver as many a man knows
   <br/>
   Nowt to eat and I've worn out my clothes
   <br/>
   Stockings I've none and no looms to weave on
   <br/>
   I've woven myself to the far end...
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
