   In the summer we'll go walking
   <br/>
   Way down to the river down the Curra road
   <br/>
   There's a blue sky we'll walk under
   <br/>
   Listen to the humming bees and on we'll go
   <br/>
   We won't worry about the traffic
   <br/>
   Worry about the way to go, worry about the phone
   <br/>
   In the summer we'll go walking
   <br/>
   Way down to the river down the Curra road
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Past the cattle at their grazing
   <br/>
   Through the woods of hazel, holly, birch and oak
   <br/>
   Past the robin on the gatepost
   <br/>
   Singing to the bluebells, sunlight is their host
   <br/>
   We won't worry about the winter
   <br/>
   Worry about it raining, worry about the snow
   <br/>
   In the summer we'll go laughing
   <br/>
   Way down to the river down the dusty road
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There is music in the river
   <br/>
   Listen to it dancing underneath the bridge
   <br/>
   And the wind is hardly breathing
   <br/>
   Words onto the willow branches overhead
   <br/>
   We won't worry about the government
   <br/>
   Worry about the way to go, worry about the hay
   <br/>
   In the summer we'll go walking
   <br/>
   Hand in hand together down the dusty way
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We won't worry about the government
   <br/>
   Worry about the way to go, worry about the hay
   <br/>
   In the summer we'll go walking
   <br/>
   Hand in hand together down the dusty way
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
