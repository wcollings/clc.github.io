<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
Tim Evans was a prisoner down in his prison cell<br>
And those who read about his crimes condemned his soul to hell<br>
Saying, "Go down, you murderer, go down, you murderer, go down"</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
For the killing of his own dear wife and the murder of his child<br>
The jury found him guilty, the hanging judge, he smiled<br>
Saying, "Go down, you murderer, go down, you murderer, go down"</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
They took Tim Evans from the dock and they led him to his cell<br>
They closed the door behind his back saying, "Damn your soul to hell"<br>
Saying, "Go down, you murderer, go down, you murderer, go down"</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
Tim Evans pleaded innocent, he swore by Him on high<br>
He never killed his own dear wife nor caused his child to die<br>
Saying, "Go down, you murderer, go down, you murderer, go down"</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
Tim Evans walked around the yard, some screws, they walked behind<br>
He saw the sky above the wall, he knew no peace of mind<br>
Saying, "Go down, you murderer, go down, you murderer, go down"</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
The governor came to his cell, the chaplain by his side<br>
Saying, "Your appeal has been turned down, prepare yourself to die"<br>
Saying, "Go down, you murderer, go down, you murderer, go down"</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
They took Tim Evans to the place where the hangman did prepare<br>
They tied a rope around his neck with a knot behind his ear<br>
Saying, "Go down, you murderer, go down, you murderer, go down"</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
A thousand lads were screaming and cursing at the doors<br>
Tim Evans didn't hear them, he was deaf forever more<br>
Saying, "Go down, you murderer, go down, you murderer, go down"</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
They sent Tim Evans to the dock for a crime he didn't do<br>
It's Christy was the murderer, the judge and jury, too<br>
Saying, "Go down, you murderer, go down, you murderer, go down"</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
Saying, "Go down, you murderer, go down, you murderer, go down<br>
You murderer go down"</font></p></body>
