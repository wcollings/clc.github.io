  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Tim Evans was a prisoner down in his prison cell
   <br/>
   And those who read about his crimes condemned his soul to hell
   <br/>
   Saying, "Go down, you murderer, go down, you murderer, go down"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   For the killing of his own dear wife and the murder of his child
   <br/>
   The jury found him guilty, the hanging judge, he smiled
   <br/>
   Saying, "Go down, you murderer, go down, you murderer, go down"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   They took Tim Evans from the dock and they led him to his cell
   <br/>
   They closed the door behind his back saying, "Damn your soul to hell"
   <br/>
   Saying, "Go down, you murderer, go down, you murderer, go down"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Tim Evans pleaded innocent, he swore by Him on high
   <br/>
   He never killed his own dear wife nor caused his child to die
   <br/>
   Saying, "Go down, you murderer, go down, you murderer, go down"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Tim Evans walked around the yard, some screws, they walked behind
   <br/>
   He saw the sky above the wall, he knew no peace of mind
   <br/>
   Saying, "Go down, you murderer, go down, you murderer, go down"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The governor came to his cell, the chaplain by his side
   <br/>
   Saying, "Your appeal has been turned down, prepare yourself to die"
   <br/>
   Saying, "Go down, you murderer, go down, you murderer, go down"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   They took Tim Evans to the place where the hangman did prepare
   <br/>
   They tied a rope around his neck with a knot behind his ear
   <br/>
   Saying, "Go down, you murderer, go down, you murderer, go down"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   A thousand lads were screaming and cursing at the doors
   <br/>
   Tim Evans didn't hear them, he was deaf forever more
   <br/>
   Saying, "Go down, you murderer, go down, you murderer, go down"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   They sent Tim Evans to the dock for a crime he didn't do
   <br/>
   It's Christy was the murderer, the judge and jury, too
   <br/>
   Saying, "Go down, you murderer, go down, you murderer, go down"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Saying, "Go down, you murderer, go down, you murderer, go down
   <br/>
   You murderer go down"
  </p>
