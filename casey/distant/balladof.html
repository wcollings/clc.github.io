    Tim Evans was a prisoner down in his prison cell
    <br/>
    And those who read about his crimes condemned his soul to hell
    <br/>
    Saying, "Go down, you murderer, go down, you murderer, go down"
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    For the killing of his own dear wife and the murder of his child
    <br/>
    The jury found him guilty, the hanging judge, he smiled
    <br/>
    Saying, "Go down, you murderer, go down, you murderer, go down"
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    They took Tim Evans from the dock and they led him to his cell
    <br/>
    They closed the door behind his back saying, "Damn your soul to hell"
    <br/>
    Saying, "Go down, you murderer, go down, you murderer, go down"
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    Tim Evans pleaded innocent, he swore by Him on high
    <br/>
    He never killed his own dear wife nor caused his child to die
    <br/>
    Saying, "Go down, you murderer, go down, you murderer, go down"
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    Tim Evans walked around the yard, some screws, they walked behind
    <br/>
    He saw the sky above the wall, he knew no peace of mind
    <br/>
    Saying, "Go down, you murderer, go down, you murderer, go down"
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    The governor came to his cell, the chaplain by his side
    <br/>
    Saying, "Your appeal has been turned down, prepare yourself to die"
    <br/>
    Saying, "Go down, you murderer, go down, you murderer, go down"
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    They took Tim Evans to the place where the hangman did prepare
    <br/>
    They tied a rope around his neck with a knot behind his ear
    <br/>
    Saying, "Go down, you murderer, go down, you murderer, go down"
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    A thousand lads were screaming and cursing at the doors
    <br/>
    Tim Evans didn't hear them, he was deaf forever more
    <br/>
    Saying, "Go down, you murderer, go down, you murderer, go down"
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    They sent Tim Evans to the dock for a crime he didn't do
    <br/>
    It's Christy was the murderer, the judge and jury, too
    <br/>
    Saying, "Go down, you murderer, go down, you murderer, go down"
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    Saying, "Go down, you murderer, go down, you murderer, go down
    <br/>
    You murderer go down"
   </font>
