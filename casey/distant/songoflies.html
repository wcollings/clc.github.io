  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And her mouth was as red as the fresh fallen snow
   <br/>
   The day she told me again
   <br/>
   How another man's love was as white as a raven
   <br/>
   While mine was blacker than blood
   <br/>
   How another man's love was as white as a raven
   <br/>
   While mine was blacker than blood
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And I asked if she knew for sure that the rain in her eyes
   <br/>
   Would never run dry
   <br/>
   'Til the flames of the sun ran like ice in her veins
   <br/>
   And froze the door to her heart
   <br/>
   'Til the flames of the sun ran like ice in her veins
   <br/>
   And froze the door to her heart
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And she told me the last time as if for the first time
   <br/>
   If the world turns away from the sun
   <br/>
   Then nothing and never will always be true
   <br/>
   That she would forever be mine
   <br/>
   Then nothing and never will always be true
   <br/>
   That she would forever be mine
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And I swear that the sun in her eyes turned to stone
   <br/>
   Her dress was as white as the moon
   <br/>
   The priest told me nothing, and no one was true
   <br/>
   That she would forever be mine
   <br/>
   The priest told me nothing, and no one was true
   <br/>
   That she would forever be mine
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh the blackened sole of her small bright shoe
   <br/>
   Has left it's mark in the long white hall of my heart
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
