  <p align="center">
   Just a note for the time is short, dear
   <br/>
   Hard is the work and long the day
   <br/>
   But my fond heart will be with you, Mary
   <br/>
   Although you are many, many miles away
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Kiss the children for me, Mary
   <br/>
   Do not let them pine or grieve
   <br/>
   Tell them I come working for them
   <br/>
   How our home I had to leave
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Building dams in the fields and the factories
   <br/>
   Moving concrete by the load
   <br/>
   Tell them I will be with you, Mary
   <br/>
   When I am finished working on the road
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Just a note for the time is short, dear
   <br/>
   Hard is the work and long the day
   <br/>
   But my fond heart will be with you, Mary
   <br/>
   Although you are many, many miles away
   <br/>
   Although you are many, many miles away
  </p>
