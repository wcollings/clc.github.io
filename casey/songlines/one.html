   <br/>
   One, I love
   <br/>
   Two, she loves
   <br/>
   And three, she's true to me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   All of my friends fell out with me
   <br/>
   Because I kept your company
   <br/>
   Let them say whatever they will
   <br/>
   I love my love with a free good will
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   They tell me he's poor, they tell me he's young
   <br/>
   I tell them all to hold their tongue
   <br/>
   If they could part the sand from the sea
   <br/>
   They never could part my love from me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It's over the mountain he must go
   <br/>
   Because his fortune is too low
   <br/>
   With an aching heart and a troubled mind
   <br/>
   He's leaving his own true love behind
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When I'm awake, I find no rest
   <br/>
   Until his head lies on my breast
   <br/>
   When I'm asleep I'm dreaming of
   <br/>
   My one, my dear, my own true love
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And when the fire to ice will run
   <br/>
   When the tide no longer turns
   <br/>
   When the rocks melt with the sun
   <br/>
   My love for you will have just begun
  </p>
