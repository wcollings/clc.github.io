  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She's like the swallow that flies on high
   <br/>
   She's like the river that never runs dry
   <br/>
   She's like the sun beaming on the lea shore
   <br/>
   I love my love, but love is no more
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   A maiden into her garden did go
   <br/>
   For to pluck her some wild primrose
   <br/>
   The more she plucked, the more she did pull
   <br/>
   Until this maiden's apron was full
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Then out of these roses she made a bed
   <br/>
   A scarlet pillow for her head
   <br/>
   She laid her down, no words she did speak
   <br/>
   And then this maiden's heart, it did break
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She's like the swallow that flies on high
   <br/>
   She's like the river that never runs dry
   <br/>
   She's like the sun beaming on the lea shore
   <br/>
   I love my love, but love is no more
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
