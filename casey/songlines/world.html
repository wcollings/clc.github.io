  <p align="center">
   In sixteen forty-nine to Saint George's Hill
   <br/>
   A ragged band they called the Diggers came to show the people's will
   <br/>
   They defied the landlords, they defied the law
   <br/>
   They were the dispossessed, reclaiming what was theirs
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "We come in peace," they said, "to dig and sow
   <br/>
   We come to work the land in common and to make the waste ground grow
   <br/>
   This earth divided we will make whole
   <br/>
   So it can be a common treasury for all
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The sin of property we do disdain
   <br/>
   No man has any right to buy and sell the earth for private gain
   <br/>
   By theft and murder they steal the land
   <br/>
   Now everywhere the walls rise up at their command
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   They make the laws to chain us well
   <br/>
   The clergy dazzle us with heaven or they damn us into hell
   <br/>
   We will not worship the god they serve
   <br/>
   They god of greed who feeds the rich while poor folk starve
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We work, we eat together, we need no swords
   <br/>
   We will not bow to the masters or pay rent to the lords
   <br/>
   Still we are free men though we are poor
   <br/>
   You Diggers all, stand up for glory, stand up now"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   From the men of property the order came
   <br/>
   They sent the hired men and troopers to wipe out the Diggers' claim
   <br/>
   Tear down their cottages, destroy their corn
   <br/>
   They were dispersed, but still the vision carries on
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You poor, take courage, you rich, take care
   <br/>
   This earth was made a common treasury for everyone to share
   <br/>
   All things in common, all people one
   <br/>
   We come in peace, the order came to cut them down
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
