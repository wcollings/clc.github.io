   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    You brave young sons of Erin's Isle
    <br/>
    I hope you will attend awhile
    <br/>
    'Tis the wrongs of dear old Ireland I am going to relate
    <br/>
    'Twas black and cursed was the day
    <br/>
    When our parliament was taken away
    <br/>
    And all of our griefs and sufferings commences from that day
    <br/>
    For our hardy sons and daughters fair
    <br/>
    To other countries must repair
    <br/>
    And leave their native land behind in sorrow to deplore
    <br/>
    Fo seek employment they must roam
    <br/>
    Far, far away from the native home
    <br/>
    From that sore, oppressed island that they call the shamrock shore
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    Now Ireland is with plenty blessed
    <br/>
    But the people, we are sore oppressed
    <br/>
    All by those cursed tyrants we are forced for to obey
    <br/>
    Some haughty landlords for to please
    <br/>
    Our houses and our lands they'll seize
    <br/>
    To put fifty farms into one and take us all away
    <br/>
    Regardless of the widow's sighs
    <br/>
    The mother's tears and orphan's cries
    <br/>
    In thousands we were driven from home which grieves my heart full sore
    <br/>
    We were forced by famine and disease
    <br/>
    To emigrate across the seas
    <br/>
    From that sore, opressed island that they called the shamrock shore
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    Our sustenance all taken away
    <br/>
    The tithes and taxes for to pay
    <br/>
    To support that law-protected church to which they do adhere
    <br/>
    And our Irish gentry, well you know
    <br/>
    To other countries they do go
    <br/>
    And the money from old Ireland they squandered here and there
    <br/>
    For if our squires would stay at home
    <br/>
    And not to other countries roam
    <br/>
    But to build mills and factories here to employ the laboring poor
    <br/>
    For if we had trade and commerce here
    <br/>
    To me no nation could compare
    <br/>
    To that sore, oppressed island that they call the shamrock shore
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    John Bull, he boasts, he laughs with scorn
    <br/>
    And he says that Irishman is born
    <br/>
    To be always discontented for at home we cannot agree
    <br/>
    But we'll banish the tyrants from our land
    <br/>
    And in harmony like sisters stand
    <br/>
    To demand the rights of Ireland, let us all united be
    <br/>
    And our parliament in College Green
    <br/>
    For to assemble, it will be seen
    <br/>
    And happy days in Erin's Isle we soon will have once more
    <br/>
    And dear old Ireland soon will be
    <br/>
    A great and glorious country
    <br/>
    And peace and blessings soon will smile all around the shamrock shore
   </font>
  </p>
