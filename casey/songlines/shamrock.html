  <p align="center">
   You brave young sons of Erin's Isle
   <br/>
   I hope you will attend awhile
   <br/>
   'Tis the wrongs of dear old Ireland I am going to relate
   <br/>
   'Twas black and cursed was the day
   <br/>
   When our parliament was taken away
   <br/>
   And all of our griefs and sufferings commences from that day
   <br/>
   For our hardy sons and daughters fair
   <br/>
   To other countries must repair
   <br/>
   And leave their native land behind in sorrow to deplore
   <br/>
   Fo seek employment they must roam
   <br/>
   Far, far away from the native home
   <br/>
   From that sore, oppressed island that they call the shamrock shore
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Now Ireland is with plenty blessed
   <br/>
   But the people, we are sore oppressed
   <br/>
   All by those cursed tyrants we are forced for to obey
   <br/>
   Some haughty landlords for to please
   <br/>
   Our houses and our lands they'll seize
   <br/>
   To put fifty farms into one and take us all away
   <br/>
   Regardless of the widow's sighs
   <br/>
   The mother's tears and orphan's cries
   <br/>
   In thousands we were driven from home which grieves my heart full sore
   <br/>
   We were forced by famine and disease
   <br/>
   To emigrate across the seas
   <br/>
   From that sore, opressed island that they called the shamrock shore
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Our sustenance all taken away
   <br/>
   The tithes and taxes for to pay
   <br/>
   To support that law-protected church to which they do adhere
   <br/>
   And our Irish gentry, well you know
   <br/>
   To other countries they do go
   <br/>
   And the money from old Ireland they squandered here and there
   <br/>
   For if our squires would stay at home
   <br/>
   And not to other countries roam
   <br/>
   But to build mills and factories here to employ the laboring poor
   <br/>
   For if we had trade and commerce here
   <br/>
   To me no nation could compare
   <br/>
   To that sore, oppressed island that they call the shamrock shore
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   John Bull, he boasts, he laughs with scorn
   <br/>
   And he says that Irishman is born
   <br/>
   To be always discontented for at home we cannot agree
   <br/>
   But we'll banish the tyrants from our land
   <br/>
   And in harmony like sisters stand
   <br/>
   To demand the rights of Ireland, let us all united be
   <br/>
   And our parliament in College Green
   <br/>
   For to assemble, it will be seen
   <br/>
   And happy days in Erin's Isle we soon will have once more
   <br/>
   And dear old Ireland soon will be
   <br/>
   A great and glorious country
   <br/>
   And peace and blessings soon will smile all around the shamrock shore
  </p>
