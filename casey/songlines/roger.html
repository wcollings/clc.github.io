<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
Young Roger the miller came courting of late<br>
To a farmer's fine daughter called beautiful Kate<br>
She had for her fortune a many fine things<br>
Beautiful silks and gold, diamonds and rings<br>
Her father, he gave her a neat plot of ground<br>
She had also a fortune, she had also a fortune of five hundred pounds</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
Then the money and supper, they both were laid down<br>
Well, it was a great sight to see five hundred pounds<br>
The sight of that money and beauty likewise<br>
Made Roger's heart greedy and dazzled his eyes<br>
"Now that your daughter and money is here<br>
'Tis I will not have her, 'tis I will not have her without that gray mare"</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
Then the money and supper were taken from sight<br>
And likewise young Kathy, his own heart's delight<br>
Roger was taken and shown out the door<br>
And ordered not for to come there anymore<br>
'Twas then he did tear at his long yellow hair<br>
Saying, "I wish I had never, I wish I had never spoke of that gray mare"</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
Now it was when six months, they were over and past<br>
And Roger the miller, he met with his lass<br>
"I think I do know you then, madam," said he<br>
"I am the same way with you, sir," said she<br>
"A man with your features with fine yellow hair<br>
Oh he once came a-courting, he once came a-courting my father's gray mare"</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
"Well, it was not a-courting the gray mare I came<br>
But you, my own jewel, my Kathy by name<br>
I thought that your father would never dispute<br>
To give me the gray mare with you to boot<br>
And not to risk lose such a dutiful son<br>
Oh it's now I am sorry, it's now I am sorry for what I have done"</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
"For your sorrow, young Roger, I have little regard<br>
For there's plenty of men in this town to be had<br>
If you forgot the gray mare, you'd be married, you see<br>
But now you have neither the gray mare nor me<br>
The price of that mare, it was never so great<br>
Oh fare you well, Roger, oh fare you well, Roger, you're a sorrowful state"</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
Now Roger's away to his desolate home<br>
And he sighs as he sits there and sups all alone<br>
Kathy, she sings, she is happy and gay<br>
She has wed a young miller who works the long day<br>
Lads, when you're courting, be always aware<br>
To court with a young maid, to court with a young maid and not the gray mare</font></p></body>
