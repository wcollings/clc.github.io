    Young Roger the miller came courting of late
    <br/>
    To a farmer's fine daughter called beautiful Kate
    <br/>
    She had for her fortune a many fine things
    <br/>
    Beautiful silks and gold, diamonds and rings
    <br/>
    Her father, he gave her a neat plot of ground
    <br/>
    She had also a fortune, she had also a fortune of five hundred pounds
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    Then the money and supper, they both were laid down
    <br/>
    Well, it was a great sight to see five hundred pounds
    <br/>
    The sight of that money and beauty likewise
    <br/>
    Made Roger's heart greedy and dazzled his eyes
    <br/>
    "Now that your daughter and money is here
    <br/>
    'Tis I will not have her, 'tis I will not have her without that gray mare"
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    Then the money and supper were taken from sight
    <br/>
    And likewise young Kathy, his own heart's delight
    <br/>
    Roger was taken and shown out the door
    <br/>
    And ordered not for to come there anymore
    <br/>
    'Twas then he did tear at his long yellow hair
    <br/>
    Saying, "I wish I had never, I wish I had never spoke of that gray mare"
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    Now it was when six months, they were over and past
    <br/>
    And Roger the miller, he met with his lass
    <br/>
    "I think I do know you then, madam," said he
    <br/>
    "I am the same way with you, sir," said she
    <br/>
    "A man with your features with fine yellow hair
    <br/>
    Oh he once came a-courting, he once came a-courting my father's gray mare"
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    "Well, it was not a-courting the gray mare I came
    <br/>
    But you, my own jewel, my Kathy by name
    <br/>
    I thought that your father would never dispute
    <br/>
    To give me the gray mare with you to boot
    <br/>
    And not to risk lose such a dutiful son
    <br/>
    Oh it's now I am sorry, it's now I am sorry for what I have done"
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    "For your sorrow, young Roger, I have little regard
    <br/>
    For there's plenty of men in this town to be had
    <br/>
    If you forgot the gray mare, you'd be married, you see
    <br/>
    But now you have neither the gray mare nor me
    <br/>
    The price of that mare, it was never so great
    <br/>
    Oh fare you well, Roger, oh fare you well, Roger, you're a sorrowful state"
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    Now Roger's away to his desolate home
    <br/>
    And he sighs as he sits there and sups all alone
    <br/>
    Kathy, she sings, she is happy and gay
    <br/>
    She has wed a young miller who works the long day
    <br/>
    Lads, when you're courting, be always aware
    <br/>
    To court with a young maid, to court with a young maid and not the gray mare
   </font>
