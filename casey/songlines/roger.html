  <p align="center">
   Young Roger the miller came courting of late
   <br/>
   To a farmer's fine daughter called beautiful Kate
   <br/>
   She had for her fortune a many fine things
   <br/>
   Beautiful silks and gold, diamonds and rings
   <br/>
   Her father, he gave her a neat plot of ground
   <br/>
   She had also a fortune, she had also a fortune of five hundred pounds
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Then the money and supper, they both were laid down
   <br/>
   Well, it was a great sight to see five hundred pounds
   <br/>
   The sight of that money and beauty likewise
   <br/>
   Made Roger's heart greedy and dazzled his eyes
   <br/>
   "Now that your daughter and money is here
   <br/>
   'Tis I will not have her, 'tis I will not have her without that gray mare"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Then the money and supper were taken from sight
   <br/>
   And likewise young Kathy, his own heart's delight
   <br/>
   Roger was taken and shown out the door
   <br/>
   And ordered not for to come there anymore
   <br/>
   'Twas then he did tear at his long yellow hair
   <br/>
   Saying, "I wish I had never, I wish I had never spoke of that gray mare"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Now it was when six months, they were over and past
   <br/>
   And Roger the miller, he met with his lass
   <br/>
   "I think I do know you then, madam," said he
   <br/>
   "I am the same way with you, sir," said she
   <br/>
   "A man with your features with fine yellow hair
   <br/>
   Oh he once came a-courting, he once came a-courting my father's gray mare"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Well, it was not a-courting the gray mare I came
   <br/>
   But you, my own jewel, my Kathy by name
   <br/>
   I thought that your father would never dispute
   <br/>
   To give me the gray mare with you to boot
   <br/>
   And not to risk lose such a dutiful son
   <br/>
   Oh it's now I am sorry, it's now I am sorry for what I have done"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "For your sorrow, young Roger, I have little regard
   <br/>
   For there's plenty of men in this town to be had
   <br/>
   If you forgot the gray mare, you'd be married, you see
   <br/>
   But now you have neither the gray mare nor me
   <br/>
   The price of that mare, it was never so great
   <br/>
   Oh fare you well, Roger, oh fare you well, Roger, you're a sorrowful state"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Now Roger's away to his desolate home
   <br/>
   And he sighs as he sits there and sups all alone
   <br/>
   Kathy, she sings, she is happy and gay
   <br/>
   She has wed a young miller who works the long day
   <br/>
   Lads, when you're courting, be always aware
   <br/>
   To court with a young maid, to court with a young maid and not the gray mare
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
