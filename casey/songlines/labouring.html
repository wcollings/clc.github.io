     Lyrics

  </p>
  <p align="center">
   A nobleman's son, he dreamed such a dream
   <br/>
   Of the beautifulest girl in the nation
   <br/>
   No counsel would he take, but journeys he'd make
   <br/>
   Through Ireland to seek this fair creature
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   'Twas seven long years he searched here and there
   <br/>
   'Til he came to the place where he'd meet her
   <br/>
   He opened the door and she stood on the floor
   <br/>
   She was a laboring man's daughter
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I never have seen you but once in my life
   <br/>
   And that was in a dream, you lay by me
   <br/>
   And now you're beside me, by the look in your eyes
   <br/>
   I know that you ne'er will deny me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And what's your desire, pray tell me, kind sir
   <br/>
   That you're so afraid of denial?
   <br/>
   Although I am poor, no scorn will I endure
   <br/>
   Do not put me under such trial
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   No scorn will I bring, nor any such thing
   <br/>
   And he took out a ring as a token
   <br/>
   Oh love is a thing which does hang on a string
   <br/>
   But between us it ne'er will be broken
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And if I should consent your bride for to be
   <br/>
   Your parents would both be offended
   <br/>
   Besides they would always be frowning on me
   <br/>
   Because you are highly descended
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   For father and for mother I have none in this world
   <br/>
   I have none but myself and a brother
   <br/>
   And as for my friends, they will not frown on me
   <br/>
   So we can but love one another
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So now they has gained what love and delight
   <br/>
   And they are living in joy and plenty
   <br/>
   The laboring man's daughter has married a knight
   <br/>
   Heaven protect them both together
  </p>
