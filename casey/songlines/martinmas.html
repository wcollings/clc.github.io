  <p align="center">
   It fell out upon one Martinmas time
   <br/>
   When snow lay on the border
   <br/>
   There came a troop of soldiers here
   <br/>
   To take up their winter quarters
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And they road high and they rode north
   <br/>
   And they rode o'er the border
   <br/>
   And there they met with a nice, little girl
   <br/>
   She was a farmer's daughter
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, they made her swear a solemn oath
   <br/>
   A salt tear in her eye
   <br/>
   That she would come to the quarter gates
   <br/>
   When no one would her spy
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But she's gone to the barber's shop
   <br/>
   And to the barber's shop went soon
   <br/>
   She made them cut off her long, yellow hair
   <br/>
   As short as any dragoon
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And she's gone to the tailor's shop
   <br/>
   And dressed in soldier's clothes
   <br/>
   With two long pistols down by her side
   <br/>
   A nice, little boy was she
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And she's gone to the quarter gates
   <br/>
   And loudly she does call
   <br/>
   "There comes a troop of soldiers here
   <br/>
   We must have lodgings all"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And the quartermaster, he comes down
   <br/>
   He gives her half a crown
   <br/>
   "Go find your lodgings in the town
   <br/>
   Tonight there is no room"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So she moved closer to the gates
   <br/>
   And louder she does call
   <br/>
   "Room, room, you gentlemen
   <br/>
   We must have lodgings all"
   <br/>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And the quartermaster, he comes down
   <br/>
   He gives her eighteen pence
   <br/>
   "Go find your lodgings in the town
   <br/>
   Tonight here comes a wench"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So she took a pistol from her side
   <br/>
   She blew it loud and shrill
   <br/>
   "You're all very free with your eighteen pence
   <br/>
   You're not for a girl at all"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And she took the garter from her knee
   <br/>
   The ribbon from her hair
   <br/>
   She tied them 'round the quarter gates
   <br/>
   A token she'd been there
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And when they found that it was her
   <br/>
   They tried to have her taken
   <br/>
   She slapped her spurs to her horse's side
   <br/>
   She galloped home a maiden
  </p>
