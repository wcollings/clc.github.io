  </p>
  <p align="center">
   In the morning we built the city
   <br/>
   In the afternoon walked through its streets
   <br/>
   Evening saw us leaving
   <br/>
   We wandered through our days as if they would never end
   <br/>
   All of us imagined we had endless time to spend
   <br/>
   We hardly saw the crossroads and small attention gave
   <br/>
   To the landmarks on the journey from the cradle to the grave
   <br/>
   Cradle to the grave, cradle to the grave
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Did you learn to dream in the morning?
   <br/>
   Abandon dreams in the afternoon?
   <br/>
   Wait without a hope in the evening?
   <br/>
   Did you stand there in the traces and let them feed you lies?
   <br/>
   Did you trail along behind them wearing blinkers on your eyes?
   <br/>
   Did you kiss the foot that kicked you? Did you thank them for their scorn?
   <br/>
   Did you ask for their forgiveness for the act of being born?
   <br/>
   Act of being born, act of being born
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Did you alter the face of the city?
   <br/>
   Make any change in the world you found?
   <br/>
   Or did you observe all the warning?
   <br/>
   Did you read the trespass notice? Did you keep off the grass?
   <br/>
   Did you shuffle off the pavement just to let your betters pass?
   <br/>
   Did you learn to keep your mouth shut? Were you seen and never heard?
   <br/>
   Did you learn to be obedient and jump to at a word?
   <br/>
   Jump to at a word, jump to at a word
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And did you ever demand any answer?
   <br/>
   The who and the what and the reason why
   <br/>
   And did you ever question the setup?
   <br/>
   And did you stand aside and let them choose while you took second best?
   <br/>
   Did you let them skin the cream off and then give to you the rest?
   <br/>
   Did you settle for the shoddy? And did you think it right
   <br/>
   To let them rob you right and left and never make a fight?
   <br/>
   And never make a fight, never make a fight
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   What did you learn in the morning?
   <br/>
   How much did you know in the afternoon?
   <br/>
   Were you content in the evening?
   <br/>
   And did they teach you how to question when you were at the school?
   <br/>
   Did the factory help you grow? Were you the maker or the tool?
   <br/>
   Did the place where you were living enrich your life and then?
   <br/>
   Did you mix among the standing of all your fellow men?
   <br/>
   All your fellow men, all your fellow men, all your fellow men
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
