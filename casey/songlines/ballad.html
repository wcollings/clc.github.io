<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
In the morning we built the city<br>
In the afternoon walked through its streets<br>
Evening saw us leaving<br>
We wandered through our days as if they would never end<br>
All of us imagined we had endless time to spend<br>
We hardly saw the crossroads and small attention gave<br>
To the landmarks on the journey from the cradle to the grave<br>
Cradle to the grave, cradle to the grave</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
Did you learn to dream in the morning?<br>
Abandon dreams in the afternoon?<br>
Wait without a hope in the evening?<br>
Did you stand there in the traces and let them feed you lies?<br>
Did you trail along behind them wearing blinkers on your eyes?<br>
Did you kiss the foot that kicked you? Did you thank them for their scorn?<br>
Did you ask for their forgiveness for the act of being born?<br>
Act of being born, act of being born</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
Did you alter the face of the city?<br>
Make any change in the world you found?<br>
Or did you observe all the warning?<br>
Did you read the trespass notice? Did you keep off the grass?<br>
Did you shuffle off the pavement just to let your betters pass?<br>
Did you learn to keep your mouth shut? Were you seen and never heard?<br>
Did you learn to be obedient and jump to at a word?<br>
Jump to at a word, jump to at a word</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
And did you ever demand any answer?<br>
The who and the what and the reason why<br>
And did you ever question the setup?<br>
And did you stand aside and let them choose while you took second best?<br>
Did you let them skin the cream off and then give to you the rest?<br>
Did you settle for the shoddy? And did you think it right<br>
To let them rob you right and left and never make a fight?<br>
And never make a fight, never make a fight</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
What did you learn in the morning?<br>
How much did you know in the afternoon?<br>
Were you content in the evening?<br>
And did they teach you how to question when you were at the school?<br>
Did the factory help you grow? Were you the maker or the tool?<br>
Did the place where you were living enrich your life and then?<br>
Did you mix among the standing of all your fellow men?<br>
All your fellow men, all your fellow men, all your fellow men</font></p></body>
