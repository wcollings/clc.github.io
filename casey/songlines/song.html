   </b>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I went out to the hazel wood because a fire was in my head
   <br/>
   And cut and pealed a hazel wand and hooked a berry to a thread
   <br/>
   And when white moths were on the wing and moth-like stars were flickering out
   <br/>
   I dropped the berry in a stream and caught a little silver trout
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When I had laid it on the floor, I went to blow the fire a-flame
   <br/>
   But something rustled on the floor, and someone called me by my name
   <br/>
   It had become a glimmering girl with apple blossom in her hair
   <br/>
   Who called me by my name and ran and faded through the brightening air
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Though I am old with wandering through hollow lands and hilly lands
   <br/>
   I will find out where she has gone and kiss her lips and take her hands
   <br/>
   And walk among long dappled grass and pluck 'til time and times are done
   <br/>
   The silver apples of the moon, the golden apples of the sun
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
 </body>
