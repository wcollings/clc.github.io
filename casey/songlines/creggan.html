  </p>
  <p align="center">
   In the lowlands of Creggan there lives a white hare
   <br/>
   As swift as a swallow as she flies through the air
   <br/>
   You may travel the country, but none could compare
   <br/>
   With the pride of the Creggan, that bonnie white hare
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   One fine Sunday morning as you may suppose
   <br/>
   A red, golden sun o'er the green mountain rose
   <br/>
   Barney Conway came down and did loudly declare
   <br/>
   "Today I'll put an end to that Creggan white hare"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So he searched through the lowlands and down through the glens
   <br/>
   Among the green rushes where the white hare had dens
   <br/>
   'Til at last coming over the bog-bank so bare
   <br/>
   From behind a white thistle out jumped the white hare
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, he gave a great yelp and his dog, she slipped, too
   <br/>
   As swift as the wind o'er the green mountain flew
   <br/>
   But the dogs soon came back, which made poor Barney sigh
   <br/>
   For he knew that the white hair had bid him good-bye
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We have some jolly sportsmen down from the Pomroy
   <br/>
   Cookstown, Dungannon and also the Moy
   <br/>
   With pedigree greyhounds, they came from afar
   <br/>
   Came down to the Creggan in their fine motor car
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   'Twas down through the lowlands these huntsmen did go
   <br/>
   To search for the white hare they tried high and low
   <br/>
   'Til at last Barney Conway, as he came on its lair
   <br/>
   Shouted out to the huntsmen, "Here lies the white hair"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So they called in their greyhounds from off the green lea
   <br/>
   And Barney and the huntsmen, they jumped high with glee
   <br/>
   And on the turf bank they all gathered around
   <br/>
   Seven men and nine dogs did the poor hare surround
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   No wonder the poor puss did tremble with fear
   <br/>
   She stood on her hind legs, she rose her big ear
   <br/>
   She ris on her toes and with one gallant spring
   <br/>
   Cleared over the greyhounds and broke through the ring
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh the chase, it went on, it was a beautiful view
   <br/>
   As swift as the wind o'er the green mountain flew
   <br/>
   But the pedigree greyhounds, they didn't get far
   <br/>
   They came back and went home in their fine motor car
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And now to conclude and to finish my rhyme
   <br/>
   I hope you'll excuse me for wasting your time
   <br/>
   If there's any amongst you in Carrickmore Fair
   <br/>
   Drink a jolly good health to the Creggan white hare
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
