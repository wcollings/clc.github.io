   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    In the lowlands of Creggan there lives a white hare
    <br/>
    As swift as a swallow as she flies through the air
    <br/>
    You may travel the country, but none could compare
    <br/>
    With the pride of the Creggan, that bonnie white hare
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    One fine Sunday morning as you may suppose
    <br/>
    A red, golden sun o'er the green mountain rose
    <br/>
    Barney Conway came down and did loudly declare
    <br/>
    "Today I'll put an end to that Creggan white hare"
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    So he searched through the lowlands and down through the glens
    <br/>
    Among the green rushes where the white hare had dens
    <br/>
    'Til at last coming over the bog-bank so bare
    <br/>
    From behind a white thistle out jumped the white hare
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    Well, he gave a great yelp and his dog, she slipped, too
    <br/>
    As swift as the wind o'er the green mountain flew
    <br/>
    But the dogs soon came back, which made poor Barney sigh
    <br/>
    For he knew that the white hair had bid him good-bye
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    We have some jolly sportsmen down from the Pomroy
    <br/>
    Cookstown, Dungannon and also the Moy
    <br/>
    With pedigree greyhounds, they came from afar
    <br/>
    Came down to the Creggan in their fine motor car
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    'Twas down through the lowlands these huntsmen did go
    <br/>
    To search for the white hare they tried high and low
    <br/>
    'Til at last Barney Conway, as he came on its lair
    <br/>
    Shouted out to the huntsmen, "Here lies the white hair"
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    So they called in their greyhounds from off the green lea
    <br/>
    And Barney and the huntsmen, they jumped high with glee
    <br/>
    And on the turf bank they all gathered around
    <br/>
    Seven men and nine dogs did the poor hare surround
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    No wonder the poor puss did tremble with fear
    <br/>
    She stood on her hind legs, she rose her big ear
    <br/>
    She ris on her toes and with one gallant spring
    <br/>
    Cleared over the greyhounds and broke through the ring
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    Oh the chase, it went on, it was a beautiful view
    <br/>
    As swift as the wind o'er the green mountain flew
    <br/>
    But the pedigree greyhounds, they didn't get far
    <br/>
    They came back and went home in their fine motor car
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    And now to conclude and to finish my rhyme
    <br/>
    I hope you'll excuse me for wasting your time
    <br/>
    If there's any amongst you in Carrickmore Fair
    <br/>
    Drink a jolly good health to the Creggan white hare
   </font>
  </p>
