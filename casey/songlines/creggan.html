<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
In the lowlands of Creggan there lives a white hare<br>
As swift as a swallow as she flies through the air<br>
You may travel the country, but none could compare<br>
With the pride of the Creggan, that bonnie white hare</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
One fine Sunday morning as you may suppose<br>
A red, golden sun o'er the green mountain rose<br>
Barney Conway came down and did loudly declare<br>
"Today I'll put an end to that Creggan white hare"</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
So he searched through the lowlands and down through the glens<br>
Among the green rushes where the white hare had dens<br>
'Til at last coming over the bog-bank so bare<br>
From behind a white thistle out jumped the white hare</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
Well, he gave a great yelp and his dog, she slipped, too<br>
As swift as the wind o'er the green mountain flew<br>
But the dogs soon came back, which made poor Barney sigh<br>
For he knew that the white hair had bid him good-bye</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
We have some jolly sportsmen down from the Pomroy<br>
Cookstown, Dungannon and also the Moy<br>
With pedigree greyhounds, they came from afar<br>
Came down to the Creggan in their fine motor car</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
'Twas down through the lowlands these huntsmen did go<br>
To search for the white hare they tried high and low<br>
'Til at last Barney Conway, as he came on its lair<br>
Shouted out to the huntsmen, "Here lies the white hair"</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
So they called in their greyhounds from off the green lea<br>
And Barney and the huntsmen, they jumped high with glee<br>
And on the turf bank they all gathered around<br>
Seven men and nine dogs did the poor hare surround</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
No wonder the poor puss did tremble with fear<br>
She stood on her hind legs, she rose her big ear<br>
She ris on her toes and with one gallant spring<br>
Cleared over the greyhounds and broke through the ring</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
Oh the chase, it went on, it was a beautiful view<br>
As swift as the wind o'er the green mountain flew<br>
But the pedigree greyhounds, they didn't get far<br>
They came back and went home in their fine motor car</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
And now to conclude and to finish my rhyme<br>
I hope you'll excuse me for wasting your time<br>
If there's any amongst you in Carrickmore Fair<br>
Drink a jolly good health to the Creggan white hare</font></p></body>
