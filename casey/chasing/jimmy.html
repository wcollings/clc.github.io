     Lyrics

  <p align="center">
   One evening of late as I went a-walking
   <br/>
   Watching the sunbeams as evening drew nigh
   <br/>
   It's onwards I rambled and I spied a fair maiden
   <br/>
   A-weeping and a-wailing with many's a sigh
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   For one who has gone and now lies lonely
   <br/>
   Lonely for one no mortal can tell
   <br/>
   Her deep roaming waters roll swiftly around him
   <br/>
   And the grass, it grows green over young Jimmy's grave
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Oh Jimmy," she cried, "Now, don't go and leave me
   <br/>
   Don't go and leave me here for to mourn
   <br/>
   Take me, oh take me along with you, darling
   <br/>
   Down to your grave and the cold, silent tomb"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "My darling," he said "You are asking a favor
   <br/>
   That no mortal on earth could grant unto thee
   <br/>
   Death is the dagger that has torn us asunder
   <br/>
   And wide is the grave, love, between you and me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   For 'tis oft times you walk by the banks of the river
   <br/>
   My spirit will watch you to guard and to keep
   <br/>
   There will I hover and ever fly over
   <br/>
   To protect you, my darling, from the cold, silent tomb
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   One fond embrace, love, and then I must leave you
   <br/>
   One loving farewell and then we must part"
   <br/>
   Cold were the arms that encircled around her
   <br/>
   And cold was the form she pressed to her heart
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So slowly he rose from the banks of the river
   <br/>
   And up to the skies he then seemed to go
   <br/>
   Leaving this fair maid by the side of the water
   <br/>
   A-weeping and a-wailing in anguish and woe
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Oh Jimmy Whelan," she cried, "Now, don't go and leave me
   <br/>
   Don't go and leave me here for to mourn
   <br/>
   Take me, oh take me along with you, darling
   <br/>
   Down to your grave and the cold, silent tomb"
  </p>
