  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Some people live the high life
   <br/>
   They live like kings and queens
   <br/>
   They go about all dressed up
   <br/>
   Well-encased in their dreams
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Most of us go from day to day
   <br/>
   Feeling we have no clout
   <br/>
   Gods, they say it's better that way
   <br/>
   Keep us going from hand to mouth
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Life is for living, and living is for loving
   <br/>
   Loving is for giving if we can be free
   <br/>
   When will we all be free?
   <br/>
   When will we all be free?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Politicians run to the altar of gold
   <br/>
   Line their pockets with greed
   <br/>
   Turning a blind eye to all around
   <br/>
   Especially the ones in need
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   McDowell's welcome is naught
   <br/>
   He builds barriers along our shores
   <br/>
   At night he stops buses and takes people off
   <br/>
   If they don't look anything like ours
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We've only dreamed of what we can be
   <br/>
   Hardly seen the color of angels
   <br/>
   When will we open our hearts to sing?
   <br/>
   Let the stars fall out and let's begin
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Life is for living, and living is for loving
   <br/>
   Loving is for giving if we can be free
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When will we all be free?
   <br/>
   When will we all be free?
  </p>
