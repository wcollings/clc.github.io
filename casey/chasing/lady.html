  <p align="center">
   Lady Mary Anne looked over the castle wall
   <br/>
   There she saw twa bonny laddies playing at the ball
   <br/>
   The youngest of them, he was the fairest of all
   <br/>
   Her bonny boy, he's young and he's growing O
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Father, dearest father, you have done me a great wrong
   <br/>
   To go and get me married to a lad who is so young
   <br/>
   He being only sixteen years and I am twenty one
   <br/>
   My bonny boy, he's young and he's growing O
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Daughter, dearest daughter, I have done you no wrong
   <br/>
   To go and get you married to a lad who is so young
   <br/>
   He will be a match for you when I am dead and gone
   <br/>
   Your bonny boy, he's young and he's growing O
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh father, dearest father, then I'll tell you what we'll do
   <br/>
   We'll send my love to college for another year or two
   <br/>
   All around his college cap we'll bind the ribbons blue
   <br/>
   To let the ladies know that he's married O
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, young Charlie Cochrane was the sprout of an oak
   <br/>
   Blithe aye and bonny and straight was his neck
   <br/>
   The sun, when it shone, it was all for his sake
   <br/>
   He will be the pride of the forest O
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Lady Mary Anne was the flower among the dew
   <br/>
   Blithe aye and bonny and straight was her shoe
   <br/>
   The longer she blossomed, well, the sweeter she grew
   <br/>
   The lily in the bud will be bonnier O
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Summer, it is gone when the leaves, they were green
   <br/>
   Happy were the days that both you and I have seen
   <br/>
   Far happier days, well, I trust will come again
   <br/>
   My bonny boy, he's young and he's growing O
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh well, at the age of sixteen years, he was a married man
   <br/>
   At the age of seventeen, the father of his son
   <br/>
   At the age of eighteen, o'er his grave the grass grew green
   <br/>
   Cruel death had put an end to his growing O
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I will weave my love a shroud of the ornamental brown
   <br/>
   Whilst I am a-weaving it, the tears, they will fall down
   <br/>
   For once I had a true love, but now he's lying low
   <br/>
   I'll nurse his bonny boy while he's growing O
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Growing O
  </p>
