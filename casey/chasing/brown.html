  <p align="center">
   As I was going down the road one fine morning
   <br/>
   Oh the brown and the yellow ale
   <br/>
   I met with a young man without any warning
   <br/>
   Oh love of my heart
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He asked me if the woman by my side was my daughter
   <br/>
   Oh the brown and the yellow ale
   <br/>
   When I said she was my wife, well, his manner did not alter
   <br/>
   Oh love of my heart
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He asked me if I'd lend her for an hour and a day
   <br/>
   Oh the brown and the yellow ale
   <br/>
   I said, "If she thinks it fair, you may take her away
   <br/>
   Oh love of my heart
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She said, "You take the high road, and I'll take off with him
   <br/>
   Oh the brown and the yellow ale
   <br/>
   And we'll meet again by the ford in the river"
   <br/>
   Oh love of my heart
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I waited by the ford for an hour and a quarter
   <br/>
   Oh the brown and the yellow ale
   <br/>
   And when she came to me, 'twas without shame I saw her
   <br/>
   Oh love of my heart
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She told me her story, I lay down and I died
   <br/>
   Oh the brown and the yellow ale
   <br/>
   She sent two men out for timber, oh she never even cried
   <br/>
   Oh love of my heart
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   A board of alder and a board of holly
   <br/>
   Oh the brown and the yellow ale
   <br/>
   And two greater yards of a shroud all about me
   <br/>
   Oh love of my heart
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Now if my own little mother, she had never been a woman
   <br/>
   Oh the brown and the yellow ale
   <br/>
   I would sing you many's another song about the women
   <br/>
   Oh love of my heart
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
