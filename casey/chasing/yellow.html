  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The yellow furze stole my heart again today
   <br/>
   The daisies in the long grasses sway
   <br/>
   Before I stepped into his domain
   <br/>
   My heart soared and sang with the wind
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I stood in by the ditch where the primroses lay
   <br/>
   Thought of my good friend Jane
   <br/>
   Who has turned her life around for herself, yes, for herself
   <br/>
   Despite the shame of it all
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   They had to hand it to her
   <br/>
   She's done well so they couldn't complain
   <br/>
   They waited for the fall
   <br/>
   And all the pain to come through
   <br/>
   With hearts already too broken
   <br/>
   Only to be frozen over in misery
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   They never said about the baby born in the barn
   <br/>
   Finding her twisted and wound up with their scorn
   <br/>
   The months she spent many miles, many miles away
   <br/>
   Dark sunglasses worn on a winter's day
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We had nowhere to turn to but the skies
   <br/>
   We followed our star around the world
   <br/>
   Now we wave and walk on each bent in our own wind
   <br/>
   Trees lean in and listen
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus 2x)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And the yellow furze stole my heart again today
   <br/>
   Daisies in the long grasses sway
   <br/>
   Before I stepped into, into his domain
   <br/>
   My heart soared and sang with the wind
  </p>
