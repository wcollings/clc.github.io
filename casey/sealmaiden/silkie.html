  <p align="center">
   I'll come up from the salty sea
   <br/>
   And watch the waves come in
   <br/>
   I'll come up from the salty sea
   <br/>
   And watch the waves come in
   <br/>
   Silkie song o'er the rain and wind
   <br/>
   Watch the waves come in
   <br/>
   Sing a song in the moon and sun
   <br/>
   A seal out of my skin
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I'll come up to the sandy beach
   <br/>
   I'll hear the silkie sing
   <br/>
   I'll come up to the sandy beach
   <br/>
   I'll hear the silkie sing
   <br/>
   Magic song and I'll sing along
   <br/>
   Hear the silkie sing
   <br/>
   Sing along in my golden coat
   <br/>
   A seal out of my skin
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I'll go down with a shopping bag
   <br/>
   All full up to the brim
   <br/>
   I'll go down with my shopping bag
   <br/>
   All full up to the brim
   <br/>
   Chocolate bars and a kettle of fish
   <br/>
   Full up to the brim
   <br/>
   Share my tea with the seals who sing
   <br/>
   We're full up to the brim
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Go to sleep with no shoes and socks
   <br/>
   I'm going for a swim
   <br/>
   Go to sleep with no shoes and socks
   <br/>
   I'm going for a swim
   <br/>
   Pack my boots in a cardboard box
   <br/>
   I'm going for a swim
   <br/>
   Read them all on the slimy rocks
   <br/>
   A seal inside my skin
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I'll come up from the salty sea
   <br/>
   And watch the waves come in
   <br/>
   I'll come up from the salty sea
   <br/>
   And watch the waves come in
  </p>

  </cleaned>
