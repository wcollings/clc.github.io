  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We're going sailing out on the silver sea
   <br/>
   Air is full of treasure, you and me
   <br/>
   All along the shore you can hear the mermaids singing
   <br/>
   No one will believe us, no one will believe us
   <br/>
   Below on the strand, the sea is answering the land
   <br/>
   No one will believe us
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We're going sailing for three nights and three days
   <br/>
   One thousand islands in Roaring Water Bay
   <br/>
   There on the hill the good people are living still
   <br/>
   No one will believe us, no one will believe us
   <br/>
   We wake in the dawn in the shadow of the thorn
   <br/>
   No one will believe us
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   How high is the mountain? How deep is the sea?
   <br/>
   How wide is the ocean between you and me?
   <br/>
   Underneath the waves, dolphins play the same games
   <br/>
   No one will believe us, no one will believe us
   <br/>
   We wake in the dawn in the shadow of the thorn
   <br/>
   No one will believe us
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Where did we get the money? How did we live so long?
   <br/>
   Out on the ocean and singing this song
   <br/>
   All along the shore you can hear the mermaids singing
   <br/>
   No one will believe us, no one will believe us
   <br/>
   Below on the strand, the sea is answering the land
   <br/>
   No one will believe us
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We're going sailing out on the silver sea
   <br/>
   Air is full of treasure, you and me
  </p>
