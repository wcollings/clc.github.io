   High in the sky, high up there
   <br/>
   The moon is laughing everywhere
   <br/>
   She has seen a stranger, she has
   <br/>
   Laughing and dancing way up there
   <br/>
   (2x)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She brings in the tide, sends us to sleep
   <br/>
   We dream in her light and think awful deep
   <br/>
   Makes us loony with her mad tune
   <br/>
   That only comes once in a true blue moon
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   High in the sky, high up there
   <br/>
   The moon is laughing everywhere
   <br/>
   She has seen a stranger, she has
   <br/>
   Laughing and dancing way up there
   <br/>
   (2x)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She brings in the tide, sends us to sleep
   <br/>
   We dream in her light and think awful deep
   <br/>
   Makes us loony with her mad tune
   <br/>
   That only comes once in a true blue moon
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   High in the sky, high up there
   <br/>
   The moon is laughing everywhere
   <br/>
   She has seen a stranger, she has
   <br/>
   Laughing and dancing way up there
