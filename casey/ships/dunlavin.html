<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
In the year of one thousand seven hundred and ninety-eight<br>
A sorrowful tale, the truth unto you I'll relate<br>
Thirty-six heroes to the world they were left to be seen<br>
By a false information were shot on Dunlavin Green</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
Bad luck to you, Saunders, for you did their lives betray<br>
You said a parade would be held on that very same day<br>
Our drums, they did rattle, our fifes, they did sweetly play<br>
Surrounded we were and privately marched away</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
Quite easy they led us like prisoners through the town<br>
To be shot on the plain, we first were forced to kneel down<br>
Such grief and such sorrow were never before there seen<br>
When the blood ran in the streams down the dykes of Dunlavin Green</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
There is young Matty Farrell who has plenty of cause to complain<br>
Likewise the two Duffys who were shot down upon the plain<br>
Young Andy Ryan, his mother distracted will run<br>
For the loss of her darling, her only beloved son</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
Some of our boys to the hills, they are going away<br>
Some of them shot and more of them going to sea<br>
Michael Dwyer in the mountains to Saunders, he owes a spleen<br>
For loss of his brothers who were shot on Dunlavin Green</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
Bad luck to you, Saunders, bad luck may you never shun<br>
May the widow's curse melt you like snow in the noonday sun<br>
Cries of the orphans, their murmurs you cannot screen<br>
For the loss of their fathers who were shot on Dunlavin Green</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
In the year of one thousand seven hundred and ninety-eight<br>
A sorrowful tale, the truth unto you I'll relate<br>
Thirty-six heroes to the world they were left to be seen<br>
By a false information were shot on Dunlavin Green</font></p></body>
