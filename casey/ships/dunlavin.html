   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    In the year of one thousand seven hundred and ninety-eight
    <br/>
    A sorrowful tale, the truth unto you I'll relate
    <br/>
    Thirty-six heroes to the world they were left to be seen
    <br/>
    By a false information were shot on Dunlavin Green
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    Bad luck to you, Saunders, for you did their lives betray
    <br/>
    You said a parade would be held on that very same day
    <br/>
    Our drums, they did rattle, our fifes, they did sweetly play
    <br/>
    Surrounded we were and privately marched away
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    Quite easy they led us like prisoners through the town
    <br/>
    To be shot on the plain, we first were forced to kneel down
    <br/>
    Such grief and such sorrow were never before there seen
    <br/>
    When the blood ran in the streams down the dykes of Dunlavin Green
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    There is young Matty Farrell who has plenty of cause to complain
    <br/>
    Likewise the two Duffys who were shot down upon the plain
    <br/>
    Young Andy Ryan, his mother distracted will run
    <br/>
    For the loss of her darling, her only beloved son
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    Some of our boys to the hills, they are going away
    <br/>
    Some of them shot and more of them going to sea
    <br/>
    Michael Dwyer in the mountains to Saunders, he owes a spleen
    <br/>
    For loss of his brothers who were shot on Dunlavin Green
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    Bad luck to you, Saunders, bad luck may you never shun
    <br/>
    May the widow's curse melt you like snow in the noonday sun
    <br/>
    Cries of the orphans, their murmurs you cannot screen
    <br/>
    For the loss of their fathers who were shot on Dunlavin Green
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    In the year of one thousand seven hundred and ninety-eight
    <br/>
    A sorrowful tale, the truth unto you I'll relate
    <br/>
    Thirty-six heroes to the world they were left to be seen
    <br/>
    By a false information were shot on Dunlavin Green
