  </p>
  <p align="center">
   In the year of one thousand seven hundred and ninety-eight
   <br/>
   A sorrowful tale, the truth unto you I'll relate
   <br/>
   Thirty-six heroes to the world they were left to be seen
   <br/>
   By a false information were shot on Dunlavin Green
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Bad luck to you, Saunders, for you did their lives betray
   <br/>
   You said a parade would be held on that very same day
   <br/>
   Our drums, they did rattle, our fifes, they did sweetly play
   <br/>
   Surrounded we were and privately marched away
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Quite easy they led us like prisoners through the town
   <br/>
   To be shot on the plain, we first were forced to kneel down
   <br/>
   Such grief and such sorrow were never before there seen
   <br/>
   When the blood ran in the streams down the dykes of Dunlavin Green
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There is young Matty Farrell who has plenty of cause to complain
   <br/>
   Likewise the two Duffys who were shot down upon the plain
   <br/>
   Young Andy Ryan, his mother distracted will run
   <br/>
   For the loss of her darling, her only beloved son
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Some of our boys to the hills, they are going away
   <br/>
   Some of them shot and more of them going to sea
   <br/>
   Michael Dwyer in the mountains to Saunders, he owes a spleen
   <br/>
   For loss of his brothers who were shot on Dunlavin Green
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Bad luck to you, Saunders, bad luck may you never shun
   <br/>
   May the widow's curse melt you like snow in the noonday sun
   <br/>
   Cries of the orphans, their murmurs you cannot screen
   <br/>
   For the loss of their fathers who were shot on Dunlavin Green
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   In the year of one thousand seven hundred and ninety-eight
   <br/>
   A sorrowful tale, the truth unto you I'll relate
   <br/>
   Thirty-six heroes to the world they were left to be seen
   <br/>
   By a false information were shot on Dunlavin Green
  </p>
