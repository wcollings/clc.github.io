   And so once again
   <br/>
   My dear Johnny, my dear friend
   <br/>
   And so once again you are fighting us all
   <br/>
   And when I ask you why
   <br/>
   You raise your sticks and cry, and I fall
   <br/>
   My friend, how did you come
   <br/>
   To trade the fiddle for the drum?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You say I have turned
   <br/>
   Like the enemies you've earned
   <br/>
   But I can remember all the good things you are
   <br/>
   And so I ask you please
   <br/>
   Can I help you find the peace and the star?
   <br/>
   My friend, what time is this
   <br/>
   To trade the handshake for the fist?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And so once again
   <br/>
   Oh America, my friend
   <br/>
   And so once again you are fighting us all
   <br/>
   And when we ask you why
   <br/>
   You raise your sticks and cry, and I fall
   <br/>
   My friend, how did you come
   <br/>
   To trade the fiddle for the drum?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You say we have turned
   <br/>
   Like the enemies you've earned
   <br/>
   But we can remember all the good things you are
   <br/>
   And so we ask you please
   <br/>
   Can we help you find the peace and the star?
   <br/>
   My friend, we have all come
   <br/>
   To fear the beating of your drum
  </p>
