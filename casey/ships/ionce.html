  <p align="center">
   I once loved a lass and I loved her so well
   <br/>
   I hated all others who spoke of her ill
   <br/>
   But now she's rewarded me well for my love
   <br/>
   She's gone to be wed to another
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I watched as my love did to the church go
   <br/>
   With bride and bride-maidens she made a fine show
   <br/>
   And I followed her on with a heart full of woe
   <br/>
   To see my love be wed to another
   <br/>
   To see my love be wed to another
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I watched as my love did sit down to dine
   <br/>
   I sat down beside her and I poured out the wine
   <br/>
   And I drank to the wee lass that should have been mine
   <br/>
   But now she is wed to another
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Well, stop," says the groomsman, "If you take my word
   <br/>
   Would you venture your life on the point of a sword?
   <br/>
   For courting too slowly you have lost this fair maiden
   <br/>
   Begone, you will never enjoy her
   <br/>
   Begone, you will never enjoy her"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Now the lads of the forest, they ask it of me
   <br/>
   "How many strawberries grow 'round the salt sea?"
   <br/>
   And I answer them back with a tear in my eye
   <br/>
   "How many ships sail in the forest?"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Go dig me a grave all large, wide and deep
   <br/>
   And cover it over with wild flowers sweet
   <br/>
   And lay me down gently for to take my long sleep
   <br/>
   And that's the best way to forget her
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So we dug him a grave all large, wide and deep
   <br/>
   And covered it over with wild flowers sweet
   <br/>
   And we laid him down gently for to take his long sleep
   <br/>
   And maybe by now he's forgotten
   <br/>
   And maybe by now he's forgotten
  </p>
