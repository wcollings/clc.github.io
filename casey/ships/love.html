  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I never thought my love would leave me
   <br/>
   Until that morning when he stepped in
   <br/>
   Well, he sat down and I sat beside him
   <br/>
   And then our troubles, they did begin
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh love is teasing and love is pleasing
   <br/>
   And love is a pleasure when first it's new
   <br/>
   But love grows older and love grows colder
   <br/>
   And it fades away like the morning dew
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There is an alehous in yon town
   <br/>
   And it's there my love goes and he sits down
   <br/>
   He takes a strange girl upon his knee
   <br/>
   And he tells to her what he once told to me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I wish my father had never whistled
   <br/>
   And I wish my mother had never sung
   <br/>
   I wish the cradle had never rocked me
   <br/>
   And I wish my life, it had not begun
  </p>
