    Come, all ye sons of Paddy's land and listen unto me
    <br/>
    'Til I relate of the hardships great a-crossing over the sea
    <br/>
    For the want of bread ten thousands fled so far across the foam
    <br/>
    And left the land where they were born called Erin's lovely home
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    Black forty-seven I'll never forget when the fever, it stalked the land
    <br/>
    And the famine without mercy, it stretched forth its dreadful hand
    <br/>
    There's many's the child in cold death lay, their parents, they did mourn
    <br/>
    While the landlord's agents pulled down our roofs in Erin's lovely home
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    My father was a farming man reared to industry
    <br/>
    He had two sons, they were men strong, and lovely daughters three
    <br/>
    Our farm was too small to feed us all, so some of us had to roam
    <br/>
    With sisters two I bid adieu to Erin's lovely home
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    My father sold the second cow, he borrowed twenty pounds
    <br/>
    And in the merry month of May we sailed from Sligo town
    <br/>
    There were thousands more left upon the shore, all anxious for to roam
    <br/>
    And leave the land where they were born called Erin's lovely home
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    We were scarcely seven days at sea when the fever, it plagued our crew
    <br/>
    They were falling like the autumn leaves bidding friends and life adieu
    <br/>
    Now the raging waves sweep o'er their graves amidst the ocean foam
    <br/>
    Their friends may mourn, but they'll never return to Erin's lovely home
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    My loving sisters, they both took ill, their lives, they were taken away
    <br/>
    And oh it grieves my heart full sore to cast them in the sea
    <br/>
    Down in the deep now they do sleep, they never more will roam
    <br/>
    In heaven I'll meet with my sisters sweet from Erin's lovely home
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    I'm in the land of liberty where plenty, it does abound
    <br/>
    Where the laboring man gets full reward for the tilling of his ground
    <br/>
    There's naught I can see that can comfort me, as an exile I must roam
    <br/>
    And end my days far, far away from Erin's lovely home
   </font>
  </p>
