  <p align="center">
   Come, all ye sons of Paddy's land and listen unto me
   <br/>
   'Til I relate of the hardships great a-crossing over the sea
   <br/>
   For the want of bread ten thousands fled so far across the foam
   <br/>
   And left the land where they were born called Erin's lovely home
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Black forty-seven I'll never forget when the fever, it stalked the land
   <br/>
   And the famine without mercy, it stretched forth its dreadful hand
   <br/>
   There's many's the child in cold death lay, their parents, they did mourn
   <br/>
   While the landlord's agents pulled down our roofs in Erin's lovely home
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   My father was a farming man reared to industry
   <br/>
   He had two sons, they were men strong, and lovely daughters three
   <br/>
   Our farm was too small to feed us all, so some of us had to roam
   <br/>
   With sisters two I bid adieu to Erin's lovely home
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   My father sold the second cow, he borrowed twenty pounds
   <br/>
   And in the merry month of May we sailed from Sligo town
   <br/>
   There were thousands more left upon the shore, all anxious for to roam
   <br/>
   And leave the land where they were born called Erin's lovely home
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We were scarcely seven days at sea when the fever, it plagued our crew
   <br/>
   They were falling like the autumn leaves bidding friends and life adieu
   <br/>
   Now the raging waves sweep o'er their graves amidst the ocean foam
   <br/>
   Their friends may mourn, but they'll never return to Erin's lovely home
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   My loving sisters, they both took ill, their lives, they were taken away
   <br/>
   And oh it grieves my heart full sore to cast them in the sea
   <br/>
   Down in the deep now they do sleep, they never more will roam
   <br/>
   In heaven I'll meet with my sisters sweet from Erin's lovely home
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I'm in the land of liberty where plenty, it does abound
   <br/>
   Where the laboring man gets full reward for the tilling of his ground
   <br/>
   There's naught I can see that can comfort me, as an exile I must roam
   <br/>
   And end my days far, far away from Erin's lovely home
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
