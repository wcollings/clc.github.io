  <p align="center">
   While goin' the road to sweet Athy
   <br/>
   Hurroo hurroo
   <br/>
   While goin' the road to sweet Athy
   <br/>
   Hurroo hurroo
   <br/>
   Goin' the road to sweet Athy
   <br/>
   A stick in me hand, a drop in me eye
   <br/>
   A doleful damsel I heard cry
   <br/>
   Johnny, I hardly knew ye
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   With your drums and guns and drums and guns
   <br/>
   Hurroo hurroo
   <br/>
   With your drums and guns and drums and guns
   <br/>
   Hurroo hurroo
   <br/>
   With drums and guns and drums and guns
   <br/>
   The enemy nearly slew ye
   <br/>
   My darling dear, you look so queer
   <br/>
   Johnny, I hardly knew ye
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Where are your eyes that were so mild?
   <br/>
   Hurroo hurroo
   <br/>
   Where are your eyes that were so mild?
   <br/>
   Hurroo hurroo
   <br/>
   Where are your eyes that were so mild
   <br/>
   When my heart you so beguiled?
   <br/>
   Why did you run from me and the child?
   <br/>
   Johnny, I hardly knew ye
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Where are your legs that used to run?
   <br/>
   Hurroo hurroo
   <br/>
   Where are your legs that used to run?
   <br/>
   Hurroo hurroo
   <br/>
   Where are your legs that used to run
   <br/>
   When you went for to carry the gun?
   <br/>
   Indeed, your dancing days are done
   <br/>
   Johnny, I hardly knew ye
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You haven't an arm, you haven't a leg
   <br/>
   Hurroo hurroo
   <br/>
   You haven't an arm, you haven't a leg
   <br/>
   Hurroo hurroo
   <br/>
   You haven't an arm, you haven't a leg
   <br/>
   You're an armless, boneless, chickenless egg
   <br/>
   You'll have to put a bowl out to beg
   <br/>
   Johnny, I hardly knew ye
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I'm happy for to see you home
   <br/>
   Hurroo hurroo
   <br/>
   I'm happy for to see you home
   <br/>
   Hurroo hurroo
   <br/>
   I'm happy for to see you home
   <br/>
   All from the island of Ceylon
   <br/>
   So low in flesh, so high in bone
   <br/>
   Johnny, I hardly knew ye
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   With your drums and guns and drums and guns
   <br/>
   Hurroo hurroo
   <br/>
   With your drums and guns and drums and guns
   <br/>
   Hurroo hurroo
   <br/>
   With drums and guns and drums and guns
   <br/>
   The enemy nearly slew ye
   <br/>
   My darling dear, you look so queer
   <br/>
   Johnny, I hardly knew ye
