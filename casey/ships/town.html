     Lyrics

  </p>
  <p align="center">
   In the town of Athlone there's a young woman walking
   <br/>
   And wrapped 'round her baby a shawl, and she speaks
   <br/>
   Of the passing of rings to the uniformed soldiers
   <br/>
   The price of a ribbon their fortune to speak
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, their fortune she speaks and she speaks of a river
   <br/>
   Whose silvery barrows and moorlands beneath
   <br/>
   Where a gun battle raged and the hero for Ireland
   <br/>
   Would soon lie down dead, dead at her feet
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   At the feet of the virgin in the grotto of Annah
   <br/>
   She sings to her baby in old styles bequeath
   <br/>
   And she lifts and laments and enchants all in hearing
   <br/>
   With songs of her people and melodies sweet
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Sweet silvery Nore river is rolling
   <br/>
   Over an Irish soldier's grave
   <br/>
   And the vestry bells are tolling
   <br/>
   Over the ashes of his grave
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   In the freeborn land of the traveling people
   <br/>
   Lies Nioclas Mullins, the pride of Cullbawn
   <br/>
   Yet unmarked beside him the bride of his union
   <br/>
   Who carried our music in a black gypsy shawl
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus 2x)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Over the ashes of his grave
   <br/>
   Over the ashes of his grave
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
 </body>
