   Believe me, if all those endearing young charms
   <br/>
   That I gaze on so fondly today
   <br/>
   Were to change by tomorrow and fleet in my arms
   <br/>
   Like fairy gifts fading away
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Thou wouldst still be adored as this moment thou art
   <br/>
   Let thy loveliness fade as it will
   <br/>
   And around the dear ruin each wish of my heart
   <br/>
   Would entwine itself verdantly still
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It's not while beauty and youth art thine own
   <br/>
   And by cheeks some profaned by a tear
   <br/>
   That the fervor and faith of the soul can be known
   <br/>
   To which time will but make thee more dear
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   No, the heart that has truly loved ne'er forgets
   <br/>
   But has truly loved on to the close
   <br/>
   As the sunflower turns on her God when He sets
   <br/>
   The fane look she turned when He rose
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Thou would still be adored as this moment thou art
   <br/>
   Let thy loveliness fade as it will
   <br/>
   And around the dear ruin each wish of my heart
   <br/>
   Would entwine itself verdantly still
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
