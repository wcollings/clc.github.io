  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The morn was breaking bright and fair, the lark sang in the sky
   <br/>
   When the maid, she combed her golden hair with a blythe glance in her eye
   <br/>
   For who beyond the bright, green wood was awaiting her with joy
   <br/>
   Oh who but gallant Reinardeen on the mountains of Pomeroy
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Full often in the dawning hour, full oft in twilight brown
   <br/>
   He met the maid in the woodland bower where the stream comes foaming down
   <br/>
   For they were faithful in a love no wars could e'er destroy
   <br/>
   No tyrant's law touched Reinardeen on the mountains of Pomeroy
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Dear love," she said, "I'm so afraid for the foeman's force and you
   <br/>
   For they've tracked you in the lowland plain and o'er the valley through
   <br/>
   My kinsmen frown when you are named, your life they would destroy
   <br/>
   'Beware,' they say, 'of Reinardeen on the mountains of Pomeroy'"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Fear not, fear not, sweetheart," he cried, "Fear not the foe for me
   <br/>
   No chains shall fall whate'er betide on the arm that would be free
   <br/>
   Oh leave your cruel kin and come when the lark is in the sky
   <br/>
   With a strong arm that I'll guard you on the mountains of Pomeroy"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The moon has come, she rose and fled from her cruel kin and home
   <br/>
   And bright the wood, and rosy-red was the tumbling torrent's foam
   <br/>
   But a mist came down, and a tempest roared and did all around destroy
   <br/>
   'Twas a pale drowned bride met Reinardeen on the mountains of Pomeroy
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
