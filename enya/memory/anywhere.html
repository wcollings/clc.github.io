  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I walk the maze of moments, but everywhere I turn to
   <br/>
   Begins a new beginning, but never finds a finish
   <br/>
   I walk to the horizon and there I find another
   <br/>
   It all seems so surprising and then I find that I know
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   You go there, you're gone forever
   <br/>
   I go there, I'll lose my way
   <br/>
   We stay here, we're not together
   <br/>
   Anywhere Is
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The moon upon the ocean is swept around in motion
   <br/>
   But without ever knowing the reason for its flowing
   <br/>
   In motion on the ocean, the moon still keeps on moving
   <br/>
   The waves still keep on waving and I still keep on going
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The shells upon the warm sands have taken from their own lands
   <br/>
   The echo of their story, but all I hear are low sounds
   <br/>
   As pillow words are weaving and willow waves are leaving
   <br/>
   But should I be believing that I am only dreaming?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I wonder if the stars sign the life that is to be mine
   <br/>
   And would they let their light shine enough for me to follow?
   <br/>
   I look up to the heavens but night has clouded over
   <br/>
   No spark of constellation; no Vela, no Orion
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   To leave the trail of all time and let it make a dark line
   <br/>
   In hopes that I can still find the way back to the moment
   <br/>
   I took the turn and turned to begin a new beginning
   <br/>
   Still looking for the answer I cannot find the finish
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It's either this or that way, it's one way or the other
   <br/>
   It should be one direction, it could be on reflection
   <br/>
   The turn I have just taken, the turn that I was making
   <br/>
   I might be just beginning, I might be near the end
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
