  <p align="center">
   Once you had gold, once you had silver
   <br/>
   Then came the rains out of the blue
   <br/>
   Ever and always, always and ever
   <br/>
   Time gave both darkness and dreams to you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Now you can see spring becomes autumn
   <br/>
   Leaves become gold falling from view
   <br/>
   Ever and always, always and ever
   <br/>
   No one can promise a dream come true
   <br/>
   Time gave both darkness and dreams to you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   What is the dark? Shadows around you
   <br/>
   Why not take heart in the new day?
   <br/>
   Ever and always, always and ever
   <br/>
   No one can promise a dream for you
   <br/>
   Time gave both darkness and dreams to you
  </p>
