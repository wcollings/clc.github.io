   Here am I, yet another good-bye
   <br/>
   He says adiós, says adiós
   <br/>
   And do you know why
   <br/>
   She won't break down and cry?
   <br/>
   She says adiós, says adiós, good-bye
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   One by one my leaves fall
   <br/>
   One by one my tales are told
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It's no lie, she is yearning to fly
   <br/>
   She says adiós, says adiós
   <br/>
   And now you know why
   <br/>
   He's a reason to sigh
   <br/>
   She says adiós, says adiós, good-bye
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   One by one my leaves fall
   <br/>
   One by one my tales are told
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   My oh my, she was aiming to high
   <br/>
   He says adiós, says adiós
   <br/>
   And now you know why
   <br/>
   There's no moon in her sky
   <br/>
   He says adiós, says adiós, good-bye
   <br/>
   He says adiós, says adiós, good-bye
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   No good-byes for love brightens their eyes
   <br/>
   Don't say adiós, say adiós
   <br/>
   And do you know why
   <br/>
   There's a love that won't die?
   <br/>
   Don't say adiós, say adiós, good-bye
   <br/>
   Don't say adiós, say adiós, good-bye
   <br/>
   Don't say adiós, say adiós, good-bye
  </p>
