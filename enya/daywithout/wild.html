   Ever close your eyes? Ever stop and listen?
   <br/>
   Ever feel alive and you've nothing missing?
   <br/>
   You don't need a reason
   <br/>
   Let the day go on and on
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Let the rain fall down everywhere around you
   <br/>
   Give into it now, let the day surround you
   <br/>
   You don't need a reason
   <br/>
   Let the rain go on and on
  </p>

   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   What a day, what a day to take to
   <br/>
   What a way, what a way to make it through
   <br/>
   What a day, what a day to take to a wild child
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Only take the time from the helter skelter
   <br/>
   Every day you find everything's in kilter
   <br/>
   You don't need a reason
   <br/>
   Let the day go on and on
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Every summer sun, every winter evening
   <br/>
   Every spring to come, every autumn leaving
   <br/>
   You don't need a reason
   <br/>
   Let it all go on and on
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus 2x)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   What a day, what a day to take to
   <br/>
   What a way, what a way to make it through
   <br/>
   What a day, what a day to take to
   <br/>
   What a way, what a way to make it through
   <br/>
   What a way, what a way to make it through
   <br/>
   What a day, what a day to take to a wild child
   <br/>
   What a day, what a day to take to a wild child
