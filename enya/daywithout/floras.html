  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Lovers in the long grass look above them
   <br/>
   Only they can see where the clouds are going
   <br/>
   Only to discover dust and sunlight
   <br/>
   Ever make the sky so blue
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Afternoon is hazy, river flowing
   <br/>
   All around the sounds moving closer to them
   <br/>
   Telling them the story told by Flora
   <br/>
   Dreams they never knew
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Silverwillows, tears from Persia
   <br/>
   Those who come from a far-off island
   <br/>
   Winter Chanterelle lies under cover
   <br/>
   Glory-of-the-sun in blue
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Some they know as passion, some as freedom
   <br/>
   Some they know as love and the way it leaves them
   <br/>
   Summer snowflake for a season
   <br/>
   When the sky above is blue
   <br/>
   When the sky above is blue
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Lying in the long grass close beside her
   <br/>
   Giving her the name of the one the moon loves
   <br/>
   This will be the day she will remember
   <br/>
   When she knew his heart was
   <br/>
   Loving in the long grass close beside her
   <br/>
   Whispering of love and the way it leaves them
   <br/>
   Lying in the long grass in the sunlight
   <br/>
   They believe it's true love
   <br/>
   And from all around them Flora's secret
   <br/>
   Telling them of love and the way it breathes and
   <br/>
   Looking up from eyes of amaranthine
   <br/>
   They can see the sky is blue
   <br/>
   Knowing that their love is true
   <br/>
   Dreams they never knew
   <br/>
   And the sky above is blue
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
