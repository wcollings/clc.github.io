  <p align="center">
   Pilgrim, how you journey on the road you chose
   <br/>
   To find out why the winds die and where the stories go
   <br/>
   All days come from one day that much you must know
   <br/>
   You cannot change what's over but only where you go
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   One way leads to diamonds, one way leads to gold
   <br/>
   Another leads you only to everything you're told
   <br/>
   In your heart you wonder which of these is true
   <br/>
   The road that leads to nowhere, the road that leads to you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Will you find the answer in all you say and do?
   <br/>
   Will you find the answer in you?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Each heart is a pilgrim, each one wants to know
   <br/>
   The reason why the winds die and where the stories go
   <br/>
   Pilgrim, in your journey you may travel far
   <br/>
   For pilgrim, it's a long way to find out who you are
   <br/>
   Pilgrim, it's a long way to find out who you are
   <br/>
   Pilgrim, it's a long way to find out who you are
  </p>
