  <p align="center">
   Once as my heart remembers
   <br/>
   All the stars were fallen embers
   <br/>
   Once when night seemed forever
   <br/>
   I was with you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Once in the care of morning
   <br/>
   In the air was all belonging
   <br/>
   Once when that day was dawning
   <br/>
   I was with you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   How far we are from morning
   <br/>
   How far we are
   <br/>
   And the stars shining through the darkness
   <br/>
   Falling in the air
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Once as night was leaving
   <br/>
   Into us our dreams were weaving
   <br/>
   Once all dreams were worth keeping
   <br/>
   I was with you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Once when our hearts were singing
   <br/>
   I was with you
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
