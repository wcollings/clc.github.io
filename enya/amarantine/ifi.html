   Where are you this moment?
   <br/>
   Only in my dreams
   <br/>
   You're missing, but you're always
   <br/>
   A heartbeat from me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I'm lost now without you
   <br/>
   I don't know where you are
   <br/>
   I keep watching, I keep hoping
   <br/>
   But time keeps us apart
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Is there a way I can find you?
   <br/>
   Is there a sign I should know?
   <br/>
   Is there a road I could follow
   <br/>
   To bring you back home?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Winter lies before me
   <br/>
   Now you're so far away
   <br/>
   In the darkness of my dreaming
   <br/>
   The light of you will stay
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   If I could be close beside you
   <br/>
   If I could be where you are
   <br/>
   If I could reach out and touch you
   <br/>
   And bring you back home
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Is there a way I can find you?
   <br/>
   Is there a sign I should know?
   <br/>
   Is there a road I could follow
   <br/>
   To bring you back home to me?
  </p>
