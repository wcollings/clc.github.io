   From the City of Constellations to the wanderer
   <br/>
   And a Place of Rains he journeys on
   <br/>
   The City of hesitation and doubt
   <br/>
   The Island of the house the color of the sea
   <br/>
   The Plain of Mementoes he journeys on to find his love
   <br/>
   The Valley of lost time, the City of End and Endlessness
   <br/>
   The Isle of Revenents, he journeys on
   <br/>
   The City of Solitudes, the City of the distance from you
   <br/>
   The City of Words of blue and yellow and red and green
   <br/>
   He journeys on to find his love
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Where the road takes him through the City of Sleep
   <br/>
   The thinking that does not end is within him
   <br/>
   Then he dreams, the road takes him
   <br/>
   This man who is searching
   <br/>
   It brings him in silence through the night
   <br/>
   Where the Cities that do not exist, exist
   <br/>
   It brings him in silence through the night
   <br/>
   Close to the City of Realizations
   <br/>
   It is here one finds the way
   <br/>
   Mount Orison, the City of Days, the Tree of the lost
   <br/>
   He journeys on north of his love
   <br/>
   A road through a valley of darkness
   <br/>
   The islands that are not of this world
   <br/>
   He journeys on to find his love
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It is a long way through darkness
   <br/>
   To the way of the eremite
   <br/>
   The eremite sings of the world and of the journey of love
   <br/>
   Which is not lost in eternity
   <br/>
   The Valley where the moon is caught in the trees
   <br/>
   Water shows the hidden heart
   <br/>
   Endlong into midnight he journeys on
   <br/>
   The parable of day, the Room of Books
   <br/>
   Where the winds come to him and say
  </p>
