   Summer, when the day is over
   <br/>
   There's a heart a little colder
   <br/>
   Someone said good-bye
   <br/>
   But you don't know why
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Somewhere there is someone keeping
   <br/>
   All the tears they have been weeping
   <br/>
   Someone said good-bye
   <br/>
   But you don't know why
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Is there a reason why a broken heart begins to cry?
   <br/>
   Is there a reason you were lost, although you don't know why?
   <br/>
   Give me a reason why you never want to say good-bye
   <br/>
   If there's a reason, I don't know why
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Always looking for a meaning
   <br/>
   All the time you keep believing
   <br/>
   But I don't know why
   <br/>
   You won't say good-bye
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Even when the sun is shining
   <br/>
   You don't see the silver lining
   <br/>
   But I don't know why
   <br/>
   You won't say good-bye
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Is there a reason why a broken dream can never fly?
   <br/>
   Is there a reason you believe and then you close your eyes?
   <br/>
   Give me a reason why you hide away so much inside
   <br/>
   If there's a reason, I don't know why
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Is there a reason why a broken heart begins to cry?
   <br/>
   Is there a reason you were lost, although you don't know why?
   <br/>
   Give me a reason why you never want to say good-bye
   <br/>
   If there's a reason, I don't know why
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I don't know why...
  </p>
