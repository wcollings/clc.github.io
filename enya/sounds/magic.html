  <p align="center">
   When the stars are in the skies
   <br/>
   Make a wish, then close your eyes
   <br/>
   Are you dreaming? Angels singing
   <br/>
   Everything is right
   <br/>
   It's the magic of the night
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Far horizons made of snow
   <br/>
   Bring the hopes each child will know
   <br/>
   Someone's dreaming, bells are ringing
   <br/>
   Everything is white
   <br/>
   It's the magic of the night
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   High up in the sky
   <br/>
   Can you see a shining light?
   <br/>
   Can it be that we can see
   <br/>
   An angel who is flying, flying?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Can an angel lose their way
   <br/>
   Who of us on earth can say?
   <br/>
   Someone's dreaming, angels singing
   <br/>
   Everything is right
   <br/>
   It's the magic of the night
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   High up in the sky
   <br/>
   Can you see a shining light?
   <br/>
   Can it be that we can see
   <br/>
   An angel who is flying, flying?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When the stars are in the skies
   <br/>
   Make a wish, then close your eyes
   <br/>
   Are you dreaming? Bells are ringing
   <br/>
   Angels are in flight
   <br/>
   It's the magic of the night
   <br/>
   Angels are in flight
   <br/>
   It's the magic of the night
  </p>
