  </p>
  <p align="center">
   One toy soldier stands alone
   <br/>
   With his drum down by his side
   <br/>
   One toy soldier on his own
   <br/>
   With his drum to keep the time
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He keeps the beat
   <br/>
   Of marching feet
   <br/>
   He keeps the beat so true
   <br/>
   He's one small toy
   <br/>
   For one small boy
   <br/>
   But his heart is oh so blue
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Who can mend my broken drum?
   <br/>
   Will it be as good as new?
   <br/>
   I must play when morning comes
   <br/>
   If I don't, what shall I do?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He keeps the beat
   <br/>
   Of marching feet
   <br/>
   He keeps the beat inside
   <br/>
   While children sleep
   <br/>
   In dreams so deep
   <br/>
   There's a secret he must hide
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   For he keeps the beat
   <br/>
   Of marching feet
   <br/>
   He keeps the beat so true
   <br/>
   He wants to sing
   <br/>
   And hopes to bring
   <br/>
   Happy Christmas Day to you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He keeps the beat
   <br/>
   Of marching feet
   <br/>
   He keeps the beat inside
   <br/>
   Someone has come
   <br/>
   To mend his drum
   <br/>
   Now his heart lights up with pride
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So he keeps the beat
   <br/>
   Of marching feet
   <br/>
   He keeps the beat so true
   <br/>
   When morning comes
   <br/>
   He plays his drum
   <br/>
   Happy Christmas Day to you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Holidays are here again
   <br/>
   Happy Christmas Day to you
   <br/>
   Holidays are here again
   <br/>
   Happy Christmas Day to you
   <br/>
   Holidays are here again
   <br/>
   Happy Christmas Day to you
   <br/>
   Holidays are here again
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
