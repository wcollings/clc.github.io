  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Have you seen the mistletoe?
   <br/>
   It fills the night with kisses
   <br/>
   Have you seen the bright new star?
   <br/>
   It fills your heart with wishes
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Have you seen the candlelight?
   <br/>
   It shines from every window
   <br/>
   Have you seen the moon above?
   <br/>
   It lights the sky in silver
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Green is in the mistletoe
   <br/>
   And red is in the holly
   <br/>
   Silver in the stars above
   <br/>
   That shine on everybody
   <br/>
   Gold is in the candlelight
   <br/>
   And crimson in the embers
   <br/>
   White is in the winter night
   <br/>
   That everyone remembers
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Have you heard the boys all sigh
   <br/>
   When all the girls are skating?
   <br/>
   Have you heard the sweetheart's cry
   <br/>
   For all this time they're waiting?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Have you seen the children playing?
   <br/>
   Tiny hands are frozen
   <br/>
   Have you seen them hurry home
   <br/>
   When suddenly it's snowing
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Have you heard the bells are ringing
   <br/>
   Ringing out their story?
   <br/>
   Have you heard the choir singing?
   <br/>
   Glory, glory, glory
  </p>
