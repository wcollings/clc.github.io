  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I was born in the shadow of the Fairfield crane where the blast o' a freighter's horn
   <br/>
   Was the very first sound that reached my ears on the morning I was born
   <br/>
   I lay and I listened tae the shipyard sound coming out of the unknown
   <br/>
   And was lulled to sleep by the mother tongue that was to be my own
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But before I grew tae be one year old, I heard the sirens scream
   <br/>
   As a city watched in the blacked-out night, a wandering searchlight beam
   <br/>
   And then at last I awoke and rose tae my first day of peace
   <br/>
   For I'd learned that the battle to stay alive was never going tae cease
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I sat and I listened tae my father tell of the days that he once knew
   <br/>
   When ye either sweated for a measly wage or ye joined the parish queue
   <br/>
   As times grew harder day by day along the riverside
   <br/>
   I ofttimes heard my mother say, "It was tears that made the Clyde"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Now I've sat in the school frae nine tae four and I've dreamed of the world outside
   <br/>
   Where the riveters and the platers watch their ships slip tae the Clyde
   <br/>
   I've served ma time behind the shipyard gates and I've sometimes mourned my lot
   <br/>
   But if any man tries tae mess me about, I will fight like my father fought
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
