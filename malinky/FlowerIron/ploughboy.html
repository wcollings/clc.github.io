<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
It's of a jolly plowboy was plowing up his land<br>
With his horses in good order to keep<br>
He whistled and he sang as the plow, she jogged along<br>
His intention was to court a pretty maid, pretty maid<br>
His intention was to court a pretty maid</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
He ended his song as the plow, she jogged along<br>
Saying, "This fair maid's far above my degree<br>
If her parents, they would know, they would prove my overthrow<br>
And the first place they would send me is the sea, is the sea<br>
And the first place they would send me is the sea"</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
When her ol' father knew she was courted on the plain<br>
He vowed he would send him o'er the sea<br>
A press gang then arose and they set my love on board<br>
And they sent him to the war to be slain, to be slain<br>
And they sent him to the war to be slain</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
She's dressed herself in a suit of men's clothes<br>
Her pockets well-lined with bright gold<br>
And as she walked down the street with her red-rosy cheeks<br>
She looked just like a young sailor bold, sailor bold<br>
She looked just like a young sailor bold</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
The first one that she met was the captain of the ship<br>
And unto him she told all her woe<br>
Saying, "They took from me my joy and my own plowboy<br>
And they sent him to the war to be slain, to be slain<br>
And they sent him to the war to be slain"</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
She's pulled out a purse of the bright, shining gold<br>
Saying, "Here's fifty bright guineas and more"<br>
And she's freely laid it down for her bonnie plowboy<br>
And she's got the young man she adored, she adored<br>
And she's got the young man she adored</font></p></body>
