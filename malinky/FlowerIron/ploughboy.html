    It's of a jolly plowboy was plowing up his land
    <br/>
    With his horses in good order to keep
    <br/>
    He whistled and he sang as the plow, she jogged along
    <br/>
    His intention was to court a pretty maid, pretty maid
    <br/>
    His intention was to court a pretty maid
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    He ended his song as the plow, she jogged along
    <br/>
    Saying, "This fair maid's far above my degree
    <br/>
    If her parents, they would know, they would prove my overthrow
    <br/>
    And the first place they would send me is the sea, is the sea
    <br/>
    And the first place they would send me is the sea"
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    When her ol' father knew she was courted on the plain
    <br/>
    He vowed he would send him o'er the sea
    <br/>
    A press gang then arose and they set my love on board
    <br/>
    And they sent him to the war to be slain, to be slain
    <br/>
    And they sent him to the war to be slain
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    She's dressed herself in a suit of men's clothes
    <br/>
    Her pockets well-lined with bright gold
    <br/>
    And as she walked down the street with her red-rosy cheeks
    <br/>
    She looked just like a young sailor bold, sailor bold
    <br/>
    She looked just like a young sailor bold
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    The first one that she met was the captain of the ship
    <br/>
    And unto him she told all her woe
    <br/>
    Saying, "They took from me my joy and my own plowboy
    <br/>
    And they sent him to the war to be slain, to be slain
    <br/>
    And they sent him to the war to be slain"
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    She's pulled out a purse of the bright, shining gold
    <br/>
    Saying, "Here's fifty bright guineas and more"
    <br/>
    And she's freely laid it down for her bonnie plowboy
    <br/>
    And she's got the young man she adored, she adored
    <br/>
    And she's got the young man she adored
   </font>
