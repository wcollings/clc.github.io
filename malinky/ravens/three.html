   Three ravens sat upon a tree
   <br/>
   Hey doun hey derrie day
   <br/>
   Three ravens sat upon a tree
   <br/>
   Hey doun
   <br/>
   Three ravens sat upon a tree
   <br/>
   And they were black as black could be
   <br/>
   And sing la do an la do a day
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The middle ane said tae his mate
   <br/>
   Hey doun hey derrie day
   <br/>
   The middle ane said tae his mate
   <br/>
   Hey doun
   <br/>
   The middle ane said tae his mate
   <br/>
   "Oh where shall we our dinner get?"
   <br/>
   And sing la do an la do a day
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Well, it's doun intae yon grass green field
   <br/>
   Hey doun hey derrie day
   <br/>
   "Well, it's doun intae yon grass green field
   <br/>
   Hey doun
   <br/>
   "Well, it's doun intae yon grass green field
   <br/>
   There lies a knight that's newly killed"
   <br/>
   And sing la do an la do a day
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And his horse is standing at his side
   <br/>
   Hey doun hey derrie day
   <br/>
   And his horse is standing at his side
   <br/>
   Hey doun
   <br/>
   And his horse is standing at his side
   <br/>
   And thinks he might get up and ride
   <br/>
   And sing la do an la do a day
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And his hounds are lying at his feet
   <br/>
   Hey doun hey derrie day
   <br/>
   And his hounds are lying at his feet
   <br/>
   Hey doun
   <br/>
   And his hounds are lying at his feet
   <br/>
   And they lick his wounds sae sore and deep
   <br/>
   And sing la do an la do a day
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There came a lady full of woe
   <br/>
   Hey doun hey derrie day
   <br/>
   There came a lady full of woe
   <br/>
   Hey doun
   <br/>
   There came a lady full of woe
   <br/>
   As big wi' child as she could go
   <br/>
   And sing la do an la do a day
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And she's stretched hersel' doon at his side
   <br/>
   Hey doun hey derrie day
   <br/>
   And she's stretched hersel' doon at his side
   <br/>
   Hey doun
   <br/>
   And she's stretched hersel' doon at his side
   <br/>
   And for the love of him she's died
   <br/>
   And sing la do an la do a day
