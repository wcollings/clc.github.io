   There were three sisters lived in a booer
   <br/>
   Hey ho bonnie
   <br/>
   An' they a' went oot for tae pu' a flooer
   <br/>
   On the bonnie banks o' Fordie
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   An' they hadna pu'ed a flower but yin
   <br/>
   Hey ho bonnie
   <br/>
   When it's up there stapped a banished man
   <br/>
   On the bonnie banks o' Fordie
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He's taen the first yin by the hand
   <br/>
   Hey ho bonnie
   <br/>
   And he's turned her 'roond  and he's made her stand
   <br/>
   On the bonnie banks o' Fordie
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Sayin', "Will ye be a robber's wife?
   <br/>
   Hey ho bonnie
   <br/>
   Or will ye die by my penknife
   <br/>
   On the bonnie banks o' Fordie?"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Oh I'll no be a robber's wife
   <br/>
   Hey ho bonnie
   <br/>
   I'd raither die by your penknife
   <br/>
   On the bonnie banks o' Fordie"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So he's taen oot his wee penknife
   <br/>
   Hey ho bonnie
   <br/>
   And there he's twined her o' her life
   <br/>
   On the bonnie banks o' Fordie
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So he's taen the second by the hand
   <br/>
   Hey ho bonnie
   <br/>
   And he's turned her 'roond and he's made her stand
   <br/>
   On the bonnie banks o' Fordie
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Sayin', "Will ye be a robber's wife
