  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    By forest and marsh on a lonely plain
    <br/>
    Lived a harsh old miller who hated grain
    <br/>
    He hated grain, his wife the same
    <br/>
    Still to the mill the farmers came
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    On the shortest day when the sun was born
    <br/>
    The miller's wife she gave birth, too
    <br/>
    A daughter beautiful as she
    <br/>
    Was kinder than a summer's day
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    She grew to work all in the dust
    <br/>
    And sang the spring song of the thrush
    <br/>
    Then on a cold gray winter morn
    <br/>
    A marshwife came tae grind her corn
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    Said the miller, "Half your corn I'll take
    <br/>
    So you can bake your yuletide cake"
    <br/>
    But the woman said tae him wi' scorn
    <br/>
    "That price I never can afford"
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    The daughter up to her, she ran
    <br/>
    As through the marsh she had began
    <br/>
    "If you return tomorrow morn
    <br/>
    My parents to the town are gone"
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    So the daughter, she did turn the corn
    <br/>
    When the old marshwife came back next morn
    <br/>
    Saying, "For your work, reward you've won
    <br/>
    I am the mother of the sun
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    The princess of the lands around
    <br/>
    When riding out with hawk and hound
    <br/>
    Out in the fields she lost her key
    <br/>
    If you can find it, rich you'll be"
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    It's the daughter, she stepped out to find
    <br/>
    The key the mother said did lie
    <br/>
    But as she took it from the hay
    <br/>
    The princess' men their whips did flay
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    "Such a fee forsaken, ill-bred girl
    <br/>
    You'll not have these riches for yourself
    <br/>
    The key of gold we'll have from thee
    <br/>
    Or you'll not leave the woods this day"
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    It's then a noble knight drew near
    <br/>
    Up to his saddle he's lifted her
    <br/>
    His heart was taken by her sight
    <br/>
    And to the princess they did ride
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    "Since you'll not have the miller's girl
    <br/>
    Then I shall take her for myself"
    <br/>
    The keys the knight tossed in her lap
    <br/>
    And on the princess turned his back
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    But three days westward they did ride
    <br/>
    'Til his hillside fortress they did sight
    <br/>
    But what the knight, he had not said
    <br/>
    The princess with him should be wed
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    So for a month and on a day
    <br/>
    The lovers they lived happily
    <br/>
    When came in sight the princess bold
    <br/>
    With all her bitter men she rode
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    Up to the fortress soon they came
    <br/>
    The arrow flew and spear, it flashed
    <br/>
    The knight, he saw the day would lose
    <br/>
    His ten against a hundred swords
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    The daughter, she looked up and saw
    <br/>
    The mighty sun across the sky
    <br/>
    "Oh sun, my kinsmen, will you help?
    <br/>
    'Twas I who turned your mother's grain"
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    The army dark with weapons high
    <br/>
    Did stop and turn towards the sky
    <br/>
    The sun, he struck down on the men
    <br/>
    Their armor melting as they ran
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    And in their paces, they did stop
    <br/>
    Like candles set before the fire
    <br/>
    The angry princess too was lost
    <br/>
    Her body burned and turned to dust
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    The sun, his rage did die away
    <br/>
    As dusk on any summer's day
    <br/>
    He came to earth and gave away
    <br/>
    His cousin born midwinter day
   </font>
  </p>
