     Lyrics

    :

  </p>
  <p align="center">
   By forest and marsh on a lonely plain
   <br/>
   Lived a harsh old miller who hated grain
   <br/>
   He hated grain, his wife the same
   <br/>
   Still to the mill the farmers came
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   On the shortest day when the sun was born
   <br/>
   The miller's wife she gave birth, too
   <br/>
   A daughter beautiful as she
   <br/>
   Was kinder than a summer's day
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She grew to work all in the dust
   <br/>
   And sang the spring song of the thrush
   <br/>
   Then on a cold gray winter morn
   <br/>
   A marshwife came tae grind her corn
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Said the miller, "Half your corn I'll take
   <br/>
   So you can bake your yuletide cake"
   <br/>
   But the woman said tae him wi' scorn
   <br/>
   "That price I never can afford"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The daughter up to her, she ran
   <br/>
   As through the marsh she had began
   <br/>
   "If you return tomorrow morn
   <br/>
   My parents to the town are gone"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So the daughter, she did turn the corn
   <br/>
   When the old marshwife came back next morn
   <br/>
   Saying, "For your work, reward you've won
   <br/>
   I am the mother of the sun
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The princess of the lands around
   <br/>
   When riding out with hawk and hound
   <br/>
   Out in the fields she lost her key
   <br/>
   If you can find it, rich you'll be"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It's the daughter, she stepped out to find
   <br/>
   The key the mother said did lie
   <br/>
   But as she took it from the hay
   <br/>
   The princess' men their whips did flay
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Such a fee forsaken, ill-bred girl
   <br/>
   You'll not have these riches for yourself
   <br/>
   The key of gold we'll have from thee
   <br/>
   Or you'll not leave the woods this day"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It's then a noble knight drew near
   <br/>
   Up to his saddle he's lifted her
   <br/>
   His heart was taken by her sight
   <br/>
   And to the princess they did ride
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Since you'll not have the miller's girl
   <br/>
   Then I shall take her for myself"
   <br/>
   The keys the knight tossed in her lap
   <br/>
   And on the princess turned his back
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But three days westward they did ride
   <br/>
   'Til his hillside fortress they did sight
   <br/>
   But what the knight, he had not said
   <br/>
   The princess with him should be wed
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So for a month and on a day
   <br/>
   The lovers they lived happily
   <br/>
   When came in sight the princess bold
   <br/>
   With all her bitter men she rode
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Up to the fortress soon they came
   <br/>
   The arrow flew and spear, it flashed
   <br/>
   The knight, he saw the day would lose
   <br/>
   His ten against a hundred swords
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The daughter, she looked up and saw
   <br/>
   The mighty sun across the sky
   <br/>
   "Oh sun, my kinsmen, will you help?
   <br/>
   'Twas I who turned your mother's grain"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The army dark with weapons high
   <br/>
   Did stop and turn towards the sky
   <br/>
   The sun, he struck down on the men
   <br/>
   Their armor melting as they ran
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And in their paces, they did stop
   <br/>
   Like candles set before the fire
   <br/>
   The angry princess too was lost
   <br/>
   Her body burned and turned to dust
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The sun, his rage did die away
   <br/>
   As dusk on any summer's day
   <br/>
   He came to earth and gave away
   <br/>
   His cousin born midwinter day
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
