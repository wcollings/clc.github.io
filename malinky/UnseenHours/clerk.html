   Clerk Saunders and May Margaret
   <br/>
   Were walking on yon gravelled green
   <br/>
   Sad and heavy was the love
   <br/>
   I wot it fell this twa between
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "A bed, a bed," Clerk Saunders said
   <br/>
   "A bed, a bed for you and me"
   <br/>
   "Oh no, oh no," the lady cried
   <br/>
   "Until the day we mairrit be
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   For in will come my seven brithers
   <br/>
   And a' their torches burnin' bright
   <br/>
   They'll say we hae but yin sister
   <br/>
   And here she's lying wi' you this night"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "You'll tak the sword frae my scabbard
   <br/>
   And loowly, loowly lift the gin
   <br/>
   And ye maun swear a solemn oath
   <br/>
   Ye'll never let Clerk Saunders in"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "You'll tak me in your airms twa
   <br/>
   And carry me ben untae yer bed
   <br/>
   And ye maun swear a solemn oath
   <br/>
   Across your bower I ne'er did tread"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   They werenae lang untae the room
   <br/>
   They werenae lang untae the bed
   <br/>
   When in there cam her seven brithers
   <br/>
   And a' their torches were burnin' red
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oot then spak the first brither
   <br/>
   "It's lang since ere this love began"
   <br/>
   Oot then spak the second brither
   <br/>
   "It's a sin tae kill a sleepin' man"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oot then spak the third brither
   <br/>
   "We'd better gang and let them be"
   <br/>
   Oot then spak the neist o' them
   <br/>
   "You'll no be killed this nicht for me"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oot then spak the fifth brither
   <br/>
   Aye and an' angry man was he
   <br/>
   "I bear the sword in my right hand
   <br/>
   That will gar Clerk Saunders dee"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He's taen oot his lang, lang sword
   <br/>
   That he had strappit through the strae
   <br/>
   And through and through Clerk Saunders' body
   <br/>
   I wot he has garred iron gae
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Awake, awake, Clerk Saunders," she says
   <br/>
   "Awake, awake for sin and shame
   <br/>
   For the day is light, the sun shines bright
   <br/>
   And I'm afraid we will be taen"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Aye she waukened this dead man
   <br/>
   Aye she rocked him to and fro
   <br/>
   Aye she waukened this dead man
   <br/>
   But of his death she did not know
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "I'll do as much for ye, Clerk Saunders
   <br/>
   Whatever ladies wouldnae thole
   <br/>
   'Til seven years has passed and gane
   <br/>
   There's nae a shoe gaes on my sole
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There'll ne'er be a sark upon by back
   <br/>
   There'll ne'er be a kaim-straik through my hair
   <br/>
   There'll ne'er be coal or candle light
   <br/>
   Shine in my bower nae mare"
  </p>
