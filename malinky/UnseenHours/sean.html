  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oft of a pleasant morning, sunshine all adorning
   <br/>
   I heard a horn give warning with the birds' mellow call
   <br/>
   Badgers flee before us, woodcooks startle o'er us
   <br/>
   Guns in a ringing chorus amid the echoes all
   <br/>
   The fox runs high and higher, horsemen shouting nigher
   <br/>
   The maid in mourning by her geese that are all gone
   <br/>
   Now they fell the wild woods, farewell home of childhood
   <br/>
   Oh Sean o Duibhir a ghleanna, your day is o'er
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   For it is my sorrow sorest, woe the falling forest
   <br/>
   The north wind brings me no rest, and death is in the sky
   <br/>
   My faithful hound tied tightly, never sporting brightly
   <br/>
   Who would make a child laugh lightly with the tears in his eye
   <br/>
   The antlered, noble-hearted stags are never parted
   <br/>
   Never chased nor started from the whinny hills
   <br/>
   Oh if peace came but the small way I would journey down on Galway
   <br/>
   And leave, though not for always, my Erin of the ills
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   My woe and ruin through sinless death undoing
   <br/>
   Came not o'er the strewing of all my bright hopes
   <br/>
   How oft on sunny morning I would watch the spring returning
   <br/>
   The autumn leaves are falling and the dew on woodland slopes
   <br/>
   Now my land is a plunder, far my friends asunder
   <br/>
   I must hide me under branch or bramble screen
   <br/>
   And if soon I cannot save me by flight from foes who crave me
   <br/>
   Oh Sean o Duibhir a ghleanna, death will come between
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
 </body>
