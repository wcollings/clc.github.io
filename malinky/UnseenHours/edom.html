  <p align="center">
   It fell aboot the Martinmas time
   <br/>
   When the wind blew shrill and cauld
   <br/>
   Cried Edom o' Gordon tae his men
   <br/>
   "We maun draw tae some hauld"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Whit hauld, whit hauld," cried his merry men
   <br/>
   "Whit hauld sal we gang tae?"
   <br/>
   "It's tae Towie's Hoose that we maun ride
   <br/>
   And see yon fair lady"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She thocht it was her ain dear lord
   <br/>
   That she saw ridin' hame
   <br/>
   But was the traitor Edom o' Gordon
   <br/>
   That rik nae sin nor shame
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Come doon, come doon, Lady Campbell," he cried
   <br/>
   "And gie yer hoose tae me
   <br/>
   Or else this nicht I swear I'll burn
   <br/>
   Ye an' yer bairnies three"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "I winna come doon," the lady cried
   <br/>
   "For laird nor yet for loon
   <br/>
   Nor yet for any rank robber
   <br/>
   That comes frae Auchendoon"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The lady frae the battlements
   <br/>
   Twa bullets she let flee
   <br/>
   But it missed its mark wi' Gordon
   <br/>
   For it scarcely grazed his knee
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Lady Campbell," the Gordon cried
   <br/>
   "That shot will cost you dear"
   <br/>
   An' he has ca'ed tae his ain Jock
   <br/>
   Tae bring the faggots near
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "I winna come doon, ye fause Gordon
   <br/>
   I winna gie up tae ye
   <br/>
   I winna forsake ma ain dear lord
   <br/>
   That is sae far frae me"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Then up and spak her youngest son
   <br/>
   Sat on the nooris's knee
   <br/>
   "Oh open the door and let me oot
   <br/>
   For this reek is choking me"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "I wid gie up ma gowd," she cried
   <br/>
   "Ma siller and ma fee
   <br/>
   For a blast o' the whistling wind
   <br/>
   Tae blaw this reek frae me"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Then oot an' spak her dochter dear
   <br/>
   She wis baith jimp and sma'
   <br/>
   "Oh row me in a pair o' sheets
   <br/>
   And throw me ower the wa'"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   They rowed her in a pair o' sheets
   <br/>
   And threw her ower the wa'
   <br/>
   But on the point o' the Gordon's sword
   <br/>
   She got a deidly fa'
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Then Gordon turned her ower and ower
   <br/>
   And oh her face was white
   <br/>
   Ah micht had spared that bonny face
   <br/>
   Tae be some man's delight
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh pity on yon fair castle
   <br/>
   That was biggit wi' stane and lime
   <br/>
   And wae for Lady Campbell herself
   <br/>
   Burnt wi' her bairnies nine
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh three o' them were mairried wives
   <br/>
   And three o' them were bairns
   <br/>
   And three o' them were leal maidens
   <br/>
   That ne'er lay in young men's airms
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
