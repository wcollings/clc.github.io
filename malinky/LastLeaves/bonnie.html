   There once was troop of Irish dragoons
   <br/>
   Come mairchin' doon through Fyvie O
   <br/>
   The captain's fa'en in love wi' a very bonnie quine
   <br/>
   Her name that she had was pretty Peggy O
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Ah come runnin' doon the stairs, pretty Peggy, my dear
   <br/>
   Come runnin' doon the stairs, pretty Peggy O
   <br/>
   Come runnin' doon the stairs an' tie back yer yellow hair
   <br/>
   Tak' a last fareweel tae yer daddie O
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   For it's I'll buy ye ribbons an' I'll buy ye rings
   <br/>
   I'll buy ye necklaces o' lammer O
   <br/>
   I'll buy ye silken goon for tae clead ye up an' doon
   <br/>
   If ye'd just come doon intae ma chamber O"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Well, I'll hae nane o' yer ribbons, I'll hae nane o' yer rings
   <br/>
   An' nane o' yer necklaces o' lammer O
   <br/>
   An' as for silken goon, I will never put it on
   <br/>
   An' I never will enter yer chamber O"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There's mony a bonnie lass in the howe o' Auchterless
   <br/>
   An' mony a bonnie lassie in the gearie O
   <br/>
   There's mony a bonnie Jean in the toon o' Aberdeen
   <br/>
   But the flo'er o' them a' bides in Fyvie O
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, the colonel, he cries, "Mount, boys, mount, boys, mount"
   <br/>
   And the captain, he cries, "Tarry O
   <br/>
   Tarry for a while, just anither day or twa
   <br/>
   For tae see if the bonnie lass will marry O"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "I'll drink nae mair o' yer guid claret wine
   <br/>
   I'll drink nae mair o' yer glasses O
   <br/>
   For the morn is the day that I maun ride away
   <br/>
   Wi' adieu tae ye, Fyvie lassies O"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   An' it's syne e'er we got tae Old Meldrum toon
   <br/>
   Oor captain we had for tae carry O
   <br/>
   An' syne e'er we got intae bonnie Aberdeen
   <br/>
   Oor captain we had for tae bury O
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It's green grow the birks on Bonnie Ythan side
   <br/>
   And low lie the Lowlands o' Fyvie O
   <br/>
   Oor captain's name was Ned, an' he's died for a maid
   <br/>
   He's died for the sodger lass o' Fyvie O
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There once was troop of Irish dragoons
   <br/>
   Come mairchin' doon through Fyvie O
   <br/>
   The captain's fa'en in love wi' a very bonnie quine
   <br/>
   Her name that she had was pretty Peggy O
