   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    There was a squire in Edinburgh toon, and a squire o' high degree
    <br/>
    He came coortin' a comely lass, and a comely lass was she
    <br/>
    She's got consent fae her faither and her mither, fae the auld and young likewise
    <br/>
    And then she said, "I am undone," and the tears fell from her eyes
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    She wrote her love a letter and she sealed it wi' her right hand
    <br/>
    She told him that she was to be wedded to a very rich farmer's son
    <br/>
    When he read the first line o'er, he laughed and he did say
    <br/>
    "I will deprive him o' his love all on his wedding day"
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    So he wrote her back an answer and he wrote without delay
    <br/>
    He wrote her back an answer to be dressed in green array
    <br/>
    "A suit of the same it's I'll put on, your wedding to prepare
    <br/>
    My dearest dear, it's you I'll wed, in spite of all that's there"
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    He rode east and he rode west and all around the land
    <br/>
    He's gaithered a score o' the finest men to ride at his command
    <br/>
    They rode on in twos or threes, but a single man rode he
    <br/>
    'Til they arrived at the wedding house, a fine green company
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    There she poured him a glass of the new port wine, he says tae the company 'roond
    <br/>
    "Whaur is the man?" cries he, he says, "The man they call the groom?
    <br/>
    Whaur is the man?" cries he, he says, "Who will enjoy the bride?
    <br/>
    Another might love her as well as he and tak' her fae his side"
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    Well, it's up and spak' the bridegroom, and he spak' sae loud and clear
    <br/>
    "If it's for fight that you've come here, be sure I'll no' be swear"
    <br/>
    "It's no' for fight that I've come here, but friendship for to show
    <br/>
    Gin ye'll gie me a kiss o' the bonnie, bonnie bride, awa' fae you I'll go"
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    But he's ta'en her by the middle sae sma' and by the grass-green sleeve
    <br/>
    He's marched her oot o' that wedding house and the company asked no leave
    <br/>
    The drums did beat and the morning sun sae glorious tae be seen
    <br/>
    Aye they rode awa' tae Edinburgh toon, the company dressed in green
   </font>
