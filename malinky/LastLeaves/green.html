  <p align="center">
   There was a squire in Edinburgh toon, and a squire o' high degree
   <br/>
   He came coortin' a comely lass, and a comely lass was she
   <br/>
   She's got consent fae her faither and her mither, fae the auld and young likewise
   <br/>
   And then she said, "I am undone," and the tears fell from her eyes
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She wrote her love a letter and she sealed it wi' her right hand
   <br/>
   She told him that she was to be wedded to a very rich farmer's son
   <br/>
   When he read the first line o'er, he laughed and he did say
   <br/>
   "I will deprive him o' his love all on his wedding day"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So he wrote her back an answer and he wrote without delay
   <br/>
   He wrote her back an answer to be dressed in green array
   <br/>
   "A suit of the same it's I'll put on, your wedding to prepare
   <br/>
   My dearest dear, it's you I'll wed, in spite of all that's there"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He rode east and he rode west and all around the land
   <br/>
   He's gaithered a score o' the finest men to ride at his command
   <br/>
   They rode on in twos or threes, but a single man rode he
   <br/>
   'Til they arrived at the wedding house, a fine green company
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There she poured him a glass of the new port wine, he says tae the company 'roond
   <br/>
   "Whaur is the man?" cries he, he says, "The man they call the groom?
   <br/>
   Whaur is the man?" cries he, he says, "Who will enjoy the bride?
   <br/>
   Another might love her as well as he and tak' her fae his side"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, it's up and spak' the bridegroom, and he spak' sae loud and clear
   <br/>
   "If it's for fight that you've come here, be sure I'll no' be swear"
   <br/>
   "It's no' for fight that I've come here, but friendship for to show
   <br/>
   Gin ye'll gie me a kiss o' the bonnie, bonnie bride, awa' fae you I'll go"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But he's ta'en her by the middle sae sma' and by the grass-green sleeve
   <br/>
   He's marched her oot o' that wedding house and the company asked no leave
   <br/>
   The drums did beat and the morning sun sae glorious tae be seen
   <br/>
   Aye they rode awa' tae Edinburgh toon, the company dressed in green
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
