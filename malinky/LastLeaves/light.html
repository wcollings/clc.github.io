    A light dragoon came over the hill
    <br/>
    When the moon was shining clearly
    <br/>
    There was a little lady and she knew him by his horse
    <br/>
    Because she loved him dearly, dearly, so dearly
    <br/>
    There was a little lady and she knew him by his horse
    <br/>
    Because she loved him dearly
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    She's taken him by the nearside rein
    <br/>
    Led him to the stable
    <br/>
    "Here's corn and hay for your horse, young man
    <br/>
    He can eat while he is able, able, so able
    <br/>
    Here's corn and hay for your horse, young man

    He can eat while he is able"

  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    She's taken him by the lily-white hand
    <br/>
    Led him to the table
    <br/>
    "It's cakes and wine for you, my dear
    <br/>
    You can drink while you are able, able, so able
    <br/>
    It's cakes and wine for you, my dear
    <br/>
    You can drink while you are able"

    She's gone upstairs to make his bed
    <br/>
    Make it soft and comfy
    <br/>
    So nimble she's jumped into the bed
    <br/>
    To see if it was easy, easy, so easy

    So nimble he's jumped into the bed

    They've played upstairs 'til the clock struck one
    <br/>
    And the trumpets, they were sounding
    <br/>
    Her spirits, they were high and her belly, it was low
    <br/>
    An' she run home to her mammy, mammy, her mammy
    <br/>

    "Oh where have you been all the livelong night?"
    <br/>
    Enquired her anxious parents

    "I've been alone with the light dragoon
    <br/>
    Because I love him dearly, dearly, so dearly
    <br/>
    I've been alone with the light dragoon
    <br/>
    Because I love him dearly"
