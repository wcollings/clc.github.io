  <p align="center">
   A light dragoon came over the hill
   <br/>
   When the moon was shining clearly
   <br/>
   There was a little lady and she knew him by his horse
   <br/>
   Because she loved him dearly, dearly, so dearly
   <br/>
   There was a little lady and she knew him by his horse
   <br/>
   Because she loved him dearly
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She's taken him by the nearside rein
   <br/>
   Led him to the stable
   <br/>
   "Here's corn and hay for your horse, young man
   <br/>
   He can eat while he is able, able, so able
   <br/>
   Here's corn and hay for your horse, young man
   <br/>
   He can eat while he is able"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She's taken him by the lily-white hand
   <br/>
   Led him to the table
   <br/>
   "It's cakes and wine for you, my dear
   <br/>
   You can drink while you are able, able, so able
   <br/>
   It's cakes and wine for you, my dear
   <br/>
   You can drink while you are able"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She's gone upstairs to make his bed
   <br/>
   Make it soft and comfy
   <br/>
   So nimble she's jumped into the bed
   <br/>
   To see if it was easy, easy, so easy
   <br/>
   So nimble she's jumped into the bed
   <br/>
   To see if it was easy
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The light dragoon has come upstairs
   <br/>
   And put his trousers on the table
   <br/>
   So nimble he's jumped into the bed
   <br/>
   To do what he was able, able, so able
   <br/>
   So nimble he's jumped into the bed
   <br/>
   To do what he was able
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   They've played upstairs 'til the clock struck one
   <br/>
   And the trumpets, they were sounding
   <br/>
   Her spirits, they were high and her belly, it was low
   <br/>
   An' she run home to her mammy, mammy, her mammy
   <br/>
   Her spirits, they were high and her belly, it was low
   <br/>
   An' she run home to her mammy
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Oh where have you been all the livelong night?"
   <br/>
   Enquired her anxious parents
   <br/>
   "I've been alone with the light dragoon
   <br/>
   Because I love him dearly, dearly, so dearly
   <br/>
   I've been alone with the light dragoon
   <br/>
   Because I love him dearly"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   A light dragoon came over the hill
   <br/>
   When the moon was shining clearly
   <br/>
   There was a little lady and she knew him by his horse
   <br/>
   Because she loved him dearly, dearly, so dearly
   <br/>
   There was a little lady and she knew him by his horse
   <br/>
   Because she loved him dearly
