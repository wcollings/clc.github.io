  <p align="center">
   Marianna o' the Howe was a young lassie wi' gowden hair
   <br/>
   Sweet and honest, true and bonnie, and lover of one John Sinclair
   <br/>
   Marianna met the factor at the dawning, at the fold
   <br/>
   And he said, "Lie with me now, Marianna, and you will not want for gold"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Well, I thank you for your offer, but I fear it canna be
   <br/>
   I maun lie with John Sinclair, for he's the only one for me"
   <br/>
   So the factor, sore affronted, whispered evil of her name
   <br/>
   Every sorrow and misfortune 'twas Marianna was to blame
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Soon there came a deputation Marianna for to see
   <br/>
   For to slight her reputation, "The de'il has laid his hands on ye
   <br/>
   Ye've soured the cream and blighted the corn and danced wi' fairies on the hill
   <br/>
   Ye who are of devil born and ye who bow to no man's will"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Seven evenings, seven mornings they spoke of Marianna ill
   <br/>
   There they shamed her, stripped her and maimed her, but they never tamed her will
   <br/>
   "Let her sweetness not deceive you, evil hides itself right well
   <br/>
   Once within, it will never leave you, Marianna, you'll burn in hell"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Who are these who stand against me? Who are these who slight my name?
   <br/>
   Let them tell their lies before God and let them hang their heads in shame"
   <br/>
   Then she saw a sight that grieved her, all the hope inside her died
   <br/>
   John Sinclair all clad in satin standing at the factor's side
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "I was child and now a woman, but I shall be no man's wife
   <br/>
   For my love has me forsaken, and I want no more of this life"
   <br/>
   They've shorn the hair from Marianna, the witch's snare o' gowden thread
   <br/>
   Marched her tae the Gallowsha' and whipped her sair until she bled
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   In the crowd she spied her lover, and he had his new coat on
   <br/>
   Soon the flames danced all above her, and the people danced 'til the dawn
   <br/>
   Marianna o' the Howe, was a young lassie wi' gowden hair
   <br/>
   Sweet and honest, true and bonnie, betrayed by the factor and John Sinclair
  </p>
