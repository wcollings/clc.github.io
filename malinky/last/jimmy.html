   Ma name is Jimmy Waddell, Ah wis born in Summerlee
   <br/>
   A workin' Jo frae a miner's row as straight as Ah cin be
   <br/>
   Gied nae thocht tae ma future or the trade Ah wis tae dae
   <br/>
   Ma fem'ly's line was, "Tak yer time, ye'll soon find yer own way"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Faither kept me oot the mines, ma mither frae the sea
   <br/>
   Ah've tried ma hand at workin' the land, it's no' the life for me
   <br/>
   Then one day Ah met a sairgeant bold recruitin' in oor toon
   <br/>
   He looked sae braw wi' his trews an' a', so Ah signed up there an' then
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Sae Ah will follow the mairchin' drum
   <br/>
   The pipes that sound sae clear
   <br/>
   Ah'm gaun tae strive for a sodger's life
   <br/>
   There's nuthin' for me here
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Mither wisnae angry, ma faither, he jist smiled
   <br/>
   For he'd been a recruit in the First of Foot when her he'rt he'd first beguiled
   <br/>
   He telt me, "Keep yer nose clean, son, when in yer barrack room
   <br/>
   Don't show fear, don't volunteer, and keep yer heid weel doon"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   An ye will follow the mairchin' drum
   <br/>
   The pipes that sound sae clear
   <br/>
   Ye're gaun tae strive for a sodger's life
   <br/>
   There's nuthin' for ye here
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When ma freens a' heard that Ah had signed the dotted line
   <br/>
   Some cried me daft, some cried me saft, some thocht Ah'd din jist fine
   <br/>
   An' twa that Ah'd bin tae school wi' telt me they'd done the same
   <br/>
   So we drank oor share o' the Black Bull's beer, we sang oorselves back hame
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Singin', "We will follow the mairchin' drum
   <br/>
   The pipes that sound sae clear
   <br/>
   We're gaun tae strive for a sodger's life
   <br/>
   There's nuthin' for us here"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Ah nivver slept a wink that night, ma excitement hard t' bear
   <br/>
   For aw Ah heard were the sairgeant's words still ringin' in ma ear
   <br/>
   "This is peace-time, sodgerin' lads, an easy life for sure
   <br/>
   This is 1914, so what chance is there o' war?"
  </p>
