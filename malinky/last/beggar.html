   A beggar, a beggar come o'er the lea
   <br/>
   He was askin' ludgins for charity
   <br/>
   He was askin' ludgins for charity
   <br/>
   "Wad ye lo'e a beggar man O?
   <br/>
   Lassie wi' my tow-row-ray"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "A beggar, a beggar I'll never ludge again
   <br/>
   I had a dochter and Jeannie was her name
   <br/>
   I had a dochter and Jeannie was her name
   <br/>
   She run awa' wi' the beggar man O
   <br/>
   Laddie wi' my tow-row-ray"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "I'll bent my back and I'll boo my knee
   <br/>
   And I'll put a black patch o'er my e'e
   <br/>
   And a beggar, a beggar ye'll tak' me tae be
   <br/>
   An' awa' wi' you I'll gang O
   <br/>
   Laddie wi' my tow-row-ray"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Oh lassie, oh lassie, you're far too young
   <br/>
   An' ye hinnae got the cant o' the beggin' tongue
   <br/>
   An' ye hinnae got the cant o' the beggin' tongue
   <br/>
   An' wi' me ye winnae gang O
   <br/>
   Lassie wi' my tow-row-ray"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She bent her back an' she boo'd her knee
   <br/>
   An' she put a black patch o'er her e'e
   <br/>
   An' kilted her skirts up abune her knee
   <br/>
   An' awa' wi' him she's gang O
   <br/>
   Laddie wi' my tow-row-ray
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Yer dochter Jean's comin' o'er the lea
   <br/>
   She's takin' hame her bairnies three
   <br/>
   She's got yin on her back an' anither on her knee
   <br/>
   An' the ither yin's toddlin' hame O
   <br/>
   Lassie wi' my tow-row-ray
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Aye a beggar, a beggar come o'er the lea
   <br/>
   He was askin' ludgins for charity
   <br/>
   He was askin' ludgins for charity
