  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The sun was shining on the English Channel, on a ferry off the coast of France
   <br/>
   And it was summer and a pleasant morning, and high above gulls wheeled and danced
   <br/>
   And high above the cliffs of morning, the gun emplacements had stood in ranks
   <br/>
   And I walked over to the railings and heard the ghosts of the Calgary Tanks
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And I remembered pictures I'd seen in history books and magazines
   <br/>
   Of three men standing, smoking, staring, among the dead on a rocky beach
   <br/>
   And in the light of that pleasant morning, as we sailed under the cliffs above
   <br/>
   I thought of all their silent prayers, and their final thoughts of the ones they loved
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   That they left behind at prairie stations, waving to their pride and joy
   <br/>
   Waving to the smiling faces, smiling faces of the soldier boys
   <br/>
   No waves of grain could claim the fallen, just the channel cold and gray as steel
   <br/>
   And no return to the rollin' prairie or a silent cross on a lonely field
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The sun was shining on the rolling prairie far from the channel cold and gray
   <br/>
   Shone on the families, friends and lovers of the prairie boys who fell that day
   <br/>
   But they could not know on that sunny morning the future held for them no joy
   <br/>
   They'd wait in vain at prairie stations, wait in vain for their soldier boys
  </p>
