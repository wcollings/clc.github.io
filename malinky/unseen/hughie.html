   Oor lords have tae the huntin' gane
   <br/>
   The huntin' o' the fallow deer
   <br/>
   And they hae grippit Hughie Graham
   <br/>
   For stealin' o' the bishop's mere
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And they hae taen him hand and fit
   <br/>
   And brocht him up through Carlisle toon
   <br/>
   The toonsfolk cried oot aw at yince
   <br/>
   Sayin', "Hugh the Graham, he maun ging doon"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Gae lowse my right hand free," he said
   <br/>
   "And pit my brand intae the same
   <br/>
   There's nane in Carlisle toon the day
   <br/>
   Daur tell the tale on Hughie Graham"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And they hae brocht a coort tae sit
   <br/>
   Mangst a' their best nobility
   <br/>
   Fifteen o' them cried aw at yince
   <br/>
   "Sir Hugh the Graham, he noo maun dee"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   They've taen him up tae the gallows hill
   <br/>
   And he lookit up at the gallows tree
   <br/>
   Yet ne'er did color leave his cheek
   <br/>
   Nor did he even blink his ee
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "And ye may gie tae ma brither John
   <br/>
   My sword that's bent wi' the metal clear
   <br/>
   And bid him come at twelve o'clock
   <br/>
   Tae see me pay the bishop's mere
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Ye may gie tae my brither James
   <br/>
   My sword that's bent wi' the metal broon
   <br/>
   And bid him come at two o'clock
   <br/>
   Tae see his brither Hugh cut doon
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And ye may tell tae my kith and kin
   <br/>
   I never did disgrace their blood
   <br/>
   And if they see the bishop's cloak
   <br/>
   Tae mak it shorter by the hood"
