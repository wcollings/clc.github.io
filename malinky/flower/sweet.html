   Sweet Willie and fair Annie sat ae day on a hill
   <br/>
   Though they had sitten seven lang year, they ne'er wad had their fill
   <br/>
   Sweet Willie said a word in haste and Annie took it ill
   <br/>
   "I winna wed a tocherless maid against ma mither's will"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "For ye're come o' the rich, Willie, and I'm come o' the poor
   <br/>
   I'm ower laich tae be your bride an' I winna be yer hooer"
   <br/>
   So Annie's gane in 'til her bower, and Willie doon the den
   <br/>
   And he's come 'til his mither's bower by the lee licht o' the moon
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Oh sleep ye, wake ye, mither?" he says, "Or are ye the bower within?"
   <br/>
   "I sleep richt aft, I wake richt aft, whit want ye wi' me, son?
   <br/>
   Whaur hae ye been a' the nicht, Willie? And wow, ye've tarried lang"
   <br/>
   "I've been courtin' fair Annie, and she is frae me gan"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "There is twa maidens in a bower, which o' them sall I bring hame?
   <br/>
   The nut-broon maid has sheep and cows, fair Annie, she's got nane"
   <br/>
   "It's an ye wed the nut-broon maid, I'll heap wi' gowd ma hand
   <br/>
   But an ye wed her fair Annie, I'd straik it wi' a wand
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The nut-broon maid has sheep and cows, fair Annie, she's got nane
   <br/>
   And Willie, for my benison, the nut-broon maid bring hame"
   <br/>
   "Oh I sall wed the nut-broon maid and I sall bring her hame
   <br/>
   But peace nor rest atween us twa, 'til death sinder's again
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   For sheep will die in cots, mither, and owsen die in byre
   <br/>
   And what's this warld's wealth to me gin I get na ma heart's desire?"
   <br/>
   "Ye'll tell her to come tae Willie's weddin' the morn at twel at noon
   <br/>
   Ye'll tell her to come tae Willie's weddin', the heir o' Duplin toon"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So he is on tae Annie's bower and he's tirled at the pin
   <br/>
   Wha was sae ready as Annie hersel tae open and let him in
   <br/>
   "It's I will come tae Willie's weddin' the morn at twel tae dine
   <br/>
   I will come tae Willie's weddin' though I'd raither it had been mine
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So maidens, tae my bower come and lay gowd on my hair
   <br/>
   And far ye laid ae plait afore, ye'll now lay ten times mair
   <br/>
   Tailors, tae my bower come and mak' tae me a weed
   <br/>
   And smiths, untae my stable come and shoe tae me a steed"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   At every tate o' Annie's horse, there hang a silver bell
   <br/>
   There cam a wind oot frae the north which made them a' tae knell
   <br/>
   Fan she came tae Marykirk and sat down in the deas
   <br/>
   The licht that cam frae fair Annie enlichtened a' the place
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But up and stands the nut-broon bride jist at her faither's knee
   <br/>
   "Oh fa is this, ma faither dear, that blinks in Willie's ee?"
   <br/>
   "Oh this is Willie's first true love afore he lov√®d thee"
   <br/>
   "Gin that be Willie's first true love, he micht hae latten me be"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Oh far got ye the water, Annie, that washes ye sae white?"
   <br/>
   "I got it in ma mither's wame far you'll ne'er get the like
   <br/>
   For ye've been washed in Dunny's well and dried on Dunny's dyke
   <br/>
   And a' the water in the sea will never wash ye white"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Fan nicht was come, and day was gane, and a' man boun' to bed
   <br/>
   Sweet Willie and the nut-broon bride were in their chamber laid
   <br/>
   They werena weel lyen doon and scarcely fa'an asleep
   <br/>
   Fan up and stands she, fair Annie, jist up at Willie's feet
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Weel brook ye o' your broom, broon bride, atween ye and the wa'
   <br/>
   And sae will I o' my winding sheet that suits me best of a'"
   <br/>
   Sad Willie raise, pit on his claise, drew 'til him hose and shoon
   <br/>
   And he is on tae Annie's bower by the lee licht o' the moon
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The firsten bower that he cam 'til there was richt dowie wark
   <br/>
   Her mither and her three sisters were makin' her a sark
   <br/>
   The neisten bower that he cam 'til there was richt dowie cheir
   <br/>
   He's lifted up the coverlet, fair Annie lay streekit there
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "It's I will kiss yer bonny cheek and I will kiss yer chin
   <br/>
   I will kiss yer clay-cald lip, but I'll ne'er kiss woman again
   <br/>
   The day ye deal at Annie's grave, the breid but and the wine
   <br/>
   Afore the morn at twel o'clock they'll deal the same at mine"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The tane was buried in Mary's kirk, the tither in Mary's quire
   <br/>
   And oot o' the tane there grew a birk, and oot o' the tither a briar
   <br/>
   And aye they grew, and aye they drew, until the twa did meet
   <br/>
   And every ane that passed them by said, "There's been lovers sweet"
  </p>
