  <p align="center">
   It's of a jolly plowboy was plowing up his land
   <br/>
   With his horses in good order to keep
   <br/>
   He whistled and he sang as the plow, she jogged along
   <br/>
   His intention was to court a pretty maid, pretty maid
   <br/>
   His intention was to court a pretty maid
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He ended his song as the plow, she jogged along
   <br/>
   Saying, "This fair maid's far above my degree
   <br/>
   If her parents, they would know, they would prove my overthrow
   <br/>
   And the first place they would send me is the sea, is the sea
   <br/>
   And the first place they would send me is the sea"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When her ol' father knew she was courted on the plain
   <br/>
   He vowed he would send him o'er the sea
   <br/>
   A press gang then arose and they set my love on board
   <br/>
   And they sent him to the war to be slain, to be slain
   <br/>
   And they sent him to the war to be slain
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She's dressed herself in a suit of men's clothes
   <br/>
   Her pockets well-lined with bright gold
   <br/>
   And as she walked down the street with her red-rosy cheeks
   <br/>
   She looked just like a young sailor bold, sailor bold
   <br/>
   She looked just like a young sailor bold
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The first one that she met was the captain of the ship
   <br/>
   And unto him she told all her woe
   <br/>
   Saying, "They took from me my joy and my own plowboy
   <br/>
   And they sent him to the war to be slain, to be slain
   <br/>
   And they sent him to the war to be slain"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She's pulled out a purse of the bright, shining gold
   <br/>
   Saying, "Here's fifty bright guineas and more"
   <br/>
   And she's freely laid it down for her bonnie plowboy
   <br/>
   And she's got the young man she adored, she adored
   <br/>
   And she's got the young man she adored
  </p>
