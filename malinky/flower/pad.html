   Says I, "My dearest Molly, come let us fix the time
   <br/>
   Fan ye and I will mairried be and wedlock us combine
   <br/>
   Fan ye and I get mairried, love, richt happy we will be
   <br/>
   For ye are the bonnie lassie that's tae pad the road wi' me"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Tae pad the road wi' you, sir, cauld winter's comin' on
   <br/>
   Besides, my aged parents have ne'er a girl but one
   <br/>
   Besides, my aged parents have ne'er a girl but me
   <br/>
   So I'm no' the bonnie lassie that's tae pad the road wi' thee"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Oh never mind cauld winter, love, the spring will follow on
   <br/>
   Come sit ye doon beside me, and I'll sing you a nice song
   <br/>
   I'll sing you a nice song while I diddle ye on ma knee
   <br/>
   For you're the bonnie lassie that's tae pad the road wi' me"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Oh the ither lads that I hae had, they proved of cruel mind
   <br/>
   They beat me and bad used me and proved tae be unkind
   <br/>
   They beat me and bad used me and garred me rue the day
   <br/>
   That e'er I gied my love tae them tae pad the road away"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Oh lassie, dearest lassie, love, I'd never dae ye wrang
   <br/>
   It's on my honest faither's life I swear I'll dae nae hairm
   <br/>
   I'll busk ye braw and fairer so ye could bear the gree
   <br/>
   As the belle o' a' the country 'roond tae pad the road wi' me"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So she has donned her hose and shoon and tae the kirk they've gaen
   <br/>
   And lang, ay lang 'ere mornin' that couple were made ane
   <br/>
   And lang, lang 'ere the mornin', her troubles were set free
   <br/>
   For she's the bonnie lassie that's tae pad the road wi' me
   <br/>
   For she's the bonnie lassie that's tae pad the road wi' me
   <br/>
   She's the bonnie lassie that's tae pad the road wi' me
