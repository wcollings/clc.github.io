  <p align="center">
   My father sailed away, the band played tunes of glory
   <br/>
   A giant man with ribbons, bedeviled dignity
   <br/>
   A regimental sergeant, the backbone of the Empire
   <br/>
   For God and righteous glory bound for High Germany
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Sweet Lord, I was just seven when Margaret was eleven
   <br/>
   They served us war for breakfast and soldiers' songs for tea
   <br/>
   "Your father's gone campaigning" was a way of not explaining
   <br/>
   That soldiers are the living proof of our inhumanity
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   My childhood passed away midst the tales and lurid stories
   <br/>
   Of manufactured glories and inhuman gallantry
   <br/>
   I asked, "When is war over?", but no one deemed to answer me
   <br/>
   And Margaret played that dreaded tune called High Germany
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   My father made it home, but he came without his reason
   <br/>
   Two eyes of molten madness, a senseless fool of war
   <br/>
   "He's just a child," my mother cried, "to be dressed in full regalia
   <br/>
   And paraded as a hero home from High Germany"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus 2x)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There'll be no tunes of glory for Margaret and me
  </p>
 </body>
