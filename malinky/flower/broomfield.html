   "I'll wager, I'll wager wi' you, fair maid
   <br/>
   Five hundred merks and ten
   <br/>
   That ye winna go tae the bonnie broom fields
   <br/>
   And return back a maiden again"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus (after each verse)
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Leatherum thee thou and aw
   <br/>
   Madam, I'm wi' you
   <br/>
   And the seal o' me be abrachee
   <br/>
   Fair maiden, I'm for you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "I'll wager, I'll wager wi' you, kind sir
   <br/>
   Five hundred merks and ten
   <br/>
   That I will go tae the bonnie broom fields
   <br/>
   And return back a maiden again"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When she cam tae the bonnie broom hills
   <br/>
   Her lover lay fast asleep
   <br/>
   Wi' his silvery bells and the gay old oak
   <br/>
   And the broomstick under his heid
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Nine times 'roond the croon o' his heid
   <br/>
   And nine times 'roond his feet
   <br/>
   Nine times she kissed his rosy lips
   <br/>
   And his breath wis wondrous sweet
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She's taen the ring frae her finger
   <br/>
   Placed it on his breist bane
   <br/>
   And a' for a token that she'd been there
   <br/>
   That she'd been there and gane
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Greetin', oh greetin' gaed she oot
   <br/>
   An' a-singin' cam she in
   <br/>
   'Twas a' for the safety o' her body
   <br/>
   And the wager she had won
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Whaur wis ye, ma bonnie gray hound
   <br/>
   That I coft ye sae dear?
   <br/>
   Ye didna wauken me frae ma sleep
   <br/>
   Whan ye kent ma love was here"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "I scraped ye wi' ma fit, maister
   <br/>
   And ma collar bell, it rang
   <br/>
   And still the mair that I did scrape
   <br/>
   Awauken wid ye nane"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Haste and haste, ma gude white steed
   <br/>
   Tae come the maiden till
   <br/>
   Or a' the birds o' the gude green wood
   <br/>
   O' your flesh shall hae their fill"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Ye needna burst yer gude white steed
   <br/>
   Wi' racing ower the howm
   <br/>
   Nae bird flies faster through the wood
   <br/>
   Than she fled through the broom"
