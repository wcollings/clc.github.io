  </p>
  <p align="center">
   All those who died for liberty have heard the eagle scream
   <br/>
   All the ones who died for liberty have died but for a dream
   <br/>
   Oh then rise, rise, rise, dark horse on the wind
   <br/>
   For in no nation on earth more broken dreams you'll find
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The flames leapt high, reached to the sky 'til they seared a nation's soul
   <br/>
   In the ashes of our broken dreams we've lost sight of our goal
   <br/>
   Oh then rise, rise, rise, dark horse on the wind
   <br/>
   And help our hearts seek Róisín, our soul again to find
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Now charlatans wear dead men's shoes, aye and rattle dead men's bones
   <br/>
   'Ere the dust has settled on their tombs, they've sold the very stones
   <br/>
   Oh then rise, rise, rise, dark horse on the wind
   <br/>
   For in no nation on the earth more Pharisees you'll find
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   In grief and hate our motherland her dragon's teeth has sown
   <br/>
   Now the warriors spring from the earth to maim and kill their own
   <br/>
   Oh then rise, rise, rise, dark horse on the wind
   <br/>
   For the one-eyed Balor still reigns king in our nation of the blind
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
