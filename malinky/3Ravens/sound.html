  <p align="center">
   Two men came to your ha' door
   <br/>
   And you did not let them in
   <br/>
   And you did not care
   <br/>
   What had brought them there
   <br/>
   They were bones covered ower wi' skin
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And when you looked again, they were five and ten
   <br/>
   All sighing a sorrowful sound
   <br/>
   Did you hear the knell
   <br/>
   Of the warning bell
   <br/>
   Or the howl of a hunting hound?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Then a hundred more came to your door
   <br/>
   A-mutterin' and a-makin' their mane
   <br/>
   Still you scorned at the skaith
   <br/>
   You were aye sick-laith
   <br/>
   To keep them fae the wind and rain
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   As the night's grew long, did you hear the throng
   <br/>
   Roar like a ralliach tide?
   <br/>
   Through the rising flood
   <br/>
   Did you hear your own blood
   <br/>
   Or the sound of a tear not cried?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   They will wait no more at your ha' door
   <br/>
   For their waiting days are done
   <br/>
   And there's no lock nor key
   <br/>
   That can hold back the sea
   <br/>
   There's no chains on the rising sun
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
 </body>
