   "Mak' yer bed fu' broad, dear Thaney
   <br/>
   Mak' yer bed fu' broad and wide
   <br/>
   There will lie a southern suitor
   <br/>
   And you shall be his bonnie bride"
   <br/>
   "Faither dear, my bed is narrow
   <br/>
   Narrow so it will remain
   <br/>
   Never will I wed a stranger
   <br/>
   I would raither lie my lane"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Then I will call you no more daughter
   <br/>
   I will call you no more mine
   <br/>
   'Til the day you die you'll wander
   <br/>
   Wander oot among the swine"
   <br/>
   Thaney fae the ha' was banished
   <br/>
   Banished oot intae the night
   <br/>
   By and by there came a lady
   <br/>
   Busked in linens lily-white
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   An' Thaney beckoned tae the lady
   <br/>
   Through the mirk she couldnae tell
   <br/>
   That it was a fair-faced laddie
   <br/>
   Come loomin' like the earl o' hell
   <br/>
   "Tak yer hands fae aff my shoulders
   <br/>
   Tak yer hands fae aff my wame"
   <br/>
   "I will tak' the one thing, lady
   <br/>
   I never can return again"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He has left her lyin' lowin'
   <br/>
   Lowin' there among the swine
   <br/>
   Thaney saw her belly growin'
   <br/>
   Growin' wi' the rue and thyme
   <br/>
   Word has gone untae the castle
   <br/>
   Word has gone untae the ha'
   <br/>
   "Thaney has lain wrang wi' a stranger
   <br/>
   She has let her snood doon fa'"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Wae be tae the wanton Thaney
   <br/>
   She has hattered at my heart
   <br/>
   Take her tae the highest mountain
   <br/>
   Tie her fast intae a cart"
   <br/>
   They have shackled Thaney's body
   <br/>
   Wi' her belly rowin' fu'
   <br/>
   Every man wi' stone stood ready
   <br/>
   For to break her back in two
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But wonders on the bonnie lady
   <br/>
   Wonders on the Berwick Law
   <br/>
   Thoough the stanes rained doon wi' fury
   <br/>
   Not a one on her did fa'
   <br/>
   Word has gone untae the castle
   <br/>
   Word has gone through a' the land
   <br/>
   "Thaney rose up like the morning
   <br/>
   She stepped softly on the strand"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Wae be tae the wanton Thaney
   <br/>
   Curses on her blithesome head
   <br/>
   Let it be by Loth here commanded
   <br/>
   I will live to see her dead
   <br/>
   Without sail or row or rudder
   <br/>
   It's you shall toss the wild, wild faem
   <br/>
   Let the ocean's dogs devour you
   <br/>
   Never more you'll rise again"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But wonders on the bonnie lady
   <br/>
   Wonders on the silver spray
   <br/>
   Cradled by five thousand fishes
   <br/>
   It's she has reached the Isle o' May
   <br/>
   Through the turning tide they tumbled
   <br/>
   Through the rattlin', rollin' storm
   <br/>
   Safe at Culross Kirk she has landed
   <br/>
   There she has her baby born
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "I will make my bed fu' narrow
   <br/>
   And in it I will lie my lane
   <br/>
   And my bonnie boy there beside me
   <br/>
   Nothing more to rue again"
  </p>

  </cleaned>
