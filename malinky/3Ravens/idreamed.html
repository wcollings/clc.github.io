  <p align="center">
   I dreamed last night of my true love
   <br/>
   And in my arms I held her
   <br/>
   But when I woke, I found she had gone
   <br/>
   I lay awake without her
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I went unto her father's gate
   <br/>
   Enquiring for my darling
   <br/>
   He said, "Young man, now you've made a mistake
   <br/>
   I've no such in my keeping"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Then her voice, it came from the roof above
   <br/>
   Came straight away from her window
   <br/>
   She said, "My love, oh I'd be but yours
   <br/>
   But locks and bolts, they do hinder"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Then the blood was shed on every side
   <br/>
   'Til I got her from among them
   <br/>
   So come, all young men, would you do likewise?
   <br/>
   Fight on until you win them
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I held my sword in my right hand
   <br/>
   And my true love in the other
   <br/>
   So come, all young men that want suchwise
   <br/>
   Fight on and take another
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
