   Billy Taylor was a sailor, he was courtin' a fair lady
   <br/>
   Instead of Billy gettin' married, he was forced untae the sea
   <br/>
   But his bride soon followed after under the name of Richard Carr
   <br/>
   Snow-white fingers, long and slender, covered ower wi' pitch and tar
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus (after each verse)
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Fal-da-ral-da-rum-dum-deddy
   <br/>
   Fal-da-ral-de-rum-dum-day
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She's dressed herself in sailor's clothing, oh but she was a bonnie young man
   <br/>
   Away she sailed upon the ocean, all aboard the Mary Anne
   <br/>
   A storm blew up upon the water, she bein' there amang the rest
   <br/>
   The wind blew off her silver buttons and there appeared her snow-white breast
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Well, now," said the captain, "My dear lady, what misfortune brought you here?"
   <br/>
   "I'm in search of my true lover whom you have pressed the other year"
   <br/>
   "Well," said the captain, "My dear lady, tell to me the young man's name"
   <br/>
   "Some folk call him Billy Taylor, William Taylor is his name"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Well, if Billy Taylor's your dear lover, then he has proved to you untrue
   <br/>
   He's got married tae another and left you here alone to rue
   <br/>
   Rise ye early in the mornin', early at the break of day
   <br/>
   And there you'll spy young Billy Taylor, walkin' oot wi' his lady gay"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She rose early up next mornin', early at the break of day
   <br/>
   And there she spied young Billy Taylor walkin' oot wi' his lady gay
   <br/>
   Gun and pistol she commanded, gun and pistol at her side
   <br/>
   And there she shot young Billy Taylor walkin' oot wi' his new-made bride
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus...)
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
