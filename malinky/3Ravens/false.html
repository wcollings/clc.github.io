  <p align="center">
   The sun shines on thon high, high hill
   <br/>
   And the sun shines on thon dowie dell
   <br/>
   The sun, it never goes doon nae mair
   <br/>
   In the place where me and my love dwell
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "And it's when will you be back, bonnie laddie?
   <br/>
   Aye and when will you be back again?"
   <br/>
   "When the heather hills are nine times burnt
   <br/>
   And the grass is growing green again"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Well, that's ower lang tae bide awa'
   <br/>
   And it's ower lang awa' fae hame
   <br/>
   And the baby that is yet unborn
   <br/>
   Will be ower lang wantin' a name"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Comfort for the comfortless
   <br/>
   Aye and honey for the bee
   <br/>
   Comfort for the comfortless
   <br/>
   But there's nane but you for me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And he's mounted on his good black steed
   <br/>
   And he's saddled up to ride
   <br/>
   She's kilted up her petticoats green
   <br/>
   And she ran swiftly by his side
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And the first toon that they came to
   <br/>
   He's bought her the bonniest hose and shoon
   <br/>
   And bade her rue and turn back noo
   <br/>
   And never follow him again
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And the second toon that they came to
   <br/>
   He's bought her the bonniest silken goon
   <br/>
   And bade her rue and turn back noo
   <br/>
   And never follow him again
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And the third toon that they came to
   <br/>
   He's bought her the bonniest weddin' ring
   <br/>
   And bade her dry her rosy cheeks
   <br/>
   And up and ride alang wi' him
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus 2x)
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
