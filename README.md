celtic lyrics corner 2.0! It's been 13 years, it's time for an update!

I want to make this a community effort to get this site updated and working! I'll keep my challenges documented, and if you find anything you want added or changed just reach out!

If you know anything about git, please do use it! fork, branch, submit pull requests, etc. It's the easiest way to handle things on my end.

If not, there's always the normal methods! Just email me. I'll get back to you as soon as I can and add your issues here.

If you want to contribute songs (first of all thank you!!) I've tried to make it pretty easy. I've got a custom script to generate the whole page from a basic text file!
Check the wiki for the syntax of that submission file, I've tried to make it pretty flexible. Or just get the script yourself (add_song.py in the root directory) and generate them
locally.

If you only have a PDF of the song, or can't get it in that format easily, don't worry! Just email me and let me know. We'll work something out
