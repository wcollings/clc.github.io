  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Will she come tonight? Will she make the train?
   <br/>
   Too gentle, lonely heart, and here's the rain
   <br/>
   An unlikely pair, they throw heavy hearts away
   <br/>
   There's nothing either one has left to say
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And though I don't get involved, yet I feel wanted
   <br/>
   I know I'll lose all I love, but do I care?
   <br/>
   I know it's not worth the pain of feeling haunted
   <br/>
   But I'm falling to earth and there's no one there
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Standing on the corner in a steady fall of rain
   <br/>
   Standing on the corner you'll never need to see again
   <br/>
   You've packed all your belongings in a case that's far too small
   <br/>
   And you can hear him trying to reach you on a black phone in the hall
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There's no way you can return home, not to his voice or to small wars
   <br/>
   There's no way you can return home, not to his voice or to small wars
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Standing on the corner in a steady fall of rain
   <br/>
   Standing on the corner you'll never need to see again
   <br/>
   And yet you opened up to me, as gentle as you are
   <br/>
   While the thorns of life ripped through your skin to draw a little blood
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There's no way you can return home, not to his voice or to small wars...
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Will she come tonight? Will she make the train?
   <br/>
   Too gentle, lonely heart, and here's the rain
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
