  <p align="center">
   You'll remember me as the west wind moves
   <br/>
   Among the fields of barley
   <br/>
   You'll forget the sun in his jealous sky
   <br/>
   As we walk in fields of gold
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So she took her love for to gaze a while
   <br/>
   Upon the fields of barley
   <br/>
   In his arms she fell as her hair came down
   <br/>
   Among the fields of gold
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Will you stay with me? Will you be my love
   <br/>
   Among the fields of barley?
   <br/>
   We'll forget the sun in his jealous sky
   <br/>
   As we lie in fields of gold
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I never made promises lightly
   <br/>
   And there have been some that I've broken
   <br/>
   But I swear in the days still left
   <br/>
   We will walk in fields of gold
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Many years have passed since those summer days
   <br/>
   Among the fields of barley
   <br/>
   See the children run as the sun goes down
   <br/>
   As we lie in fields of gold
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Will you stay with me? Will you be my love
   <br/>
   Among the fields of barley?
   <br/>
   You'll forget the sun in his jealous sky
   <br/>
   As we lie in fields of gold
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I never made promises lightly
   <br/>
   And there have been some that I've broken
   <br/>
   But I swear in the days still left
   <br/>
   We will walk in fields of gold
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You'll remember me as the west wind moves
   <br/>
   Among the fields of barley
   <br/>
   You'll forget the sun in his jealous sky
   <br/>
   As we walk in fields of gold
  </p>
