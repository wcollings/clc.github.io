   She told stories I remember
   <br/>
   They were so vivid in her mind
   <br/>
   A different age I started dreaming
   <br/>
   Just like the time
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Father did work for the labor club
   <br/>
   Never got paid
   <br/>
   She won't vote for them now
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Still you share all the good times
   <br/>
   The past that I know you're living in
   <br/>
   Stories told over and over
   <br/>
   Just like the time
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Father did work for the labor club
   <br/>
   Never got paid
   <br/>
   She won't vote for them now
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And it just goes to show
   <br/>
   You don't know who you are
   <br/>
   You don't know who you are
   <br/>
   You don't know who you are
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She told stories
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
