  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Happed in mist these twenty-five eventful years seem to him now
   <br/>
   And in all but one, a friendly gaze, a ghost of gladness by his side
   <br/>
   With horse and plough he marched with pride of the purest kind
   <br/>
   Then a blink of light and it's Flanders field and the end of time
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Through the flash and cannon roar, he saw his Christine's smiling eyes
   <br/>
   And with no more thought of blood or shell, he made his way to hold her near
   <br/>
   But truth and honor's henchmen found him leaving here
   <br/>
   A madman's rave and a coward's grave for the volunteer
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And in his eyes flew snipe and curlew, and in his nose blew moistened air
   <br/>
   And in his mind the wood the king stole that robbed the land and laid it bare
   <br/>
   But in his heart his lover's memory, singing on their wedding night
   <br/>
   Where once the parks flowed thick with corn, that sullen tune is with him now
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Happed in mist, the king's own rifles, ready, aim
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The flowers of the forest are a' we'ed awa'
  </p>
 </body>
