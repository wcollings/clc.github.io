   Take a look at these hills here
   <br/>
   It must have been some time since they were first raised up
   <br/>
   And it starts me thinking about a steerer called John Begg
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Long ago, explorer on the north currents
   <br/>
   Only small parts, but he paved the way for
   <br/>
   These long-distance conversations
   <br/>
   Cloudy day navigation we have now
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Was Kea Bay a dream?
   <br/>
   My head goes cloudy all the time
   <br/>
   Maybelline waited at the shoreline
   <br/>
   There was good reason to return
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But you fell out with that crowd
   <br/>
   You must have been confused
   <br/>
   Oh this warm summer land
   <br/>
   Can take you by surprise
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Take a look at there hills here
   <br/>
   It must have been some time since they first made you stop
   <br/>
   Their deep lines, mysteries untold, only they can know
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Only they can say
   <br/>
   What happened to the different things beyond us now
   <br/>
   Like Steerer John Begg
   <br/>
   He was a true marine
   <br/>
   He was a hero of our time
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But you fell out with that crowd
   <br/>
   You must have been confused
   <br/>
   Oh this warm summer land
   <br/>
   Can take you by surprise
   <br/>
   Oh this warm summer land
   <br/>
   Can take you by surprise
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Kealakekua Bay
   <br/>
   He was the rose of the winds
   <br/>
   He was a hero of our time
  </p>
