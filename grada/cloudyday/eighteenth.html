  <p align="center">
   All you people who live at home easy
   <br/>
   And are far from the trials of war
   <br/>
   Never knowing the danger of battle
   <br/>
   But are safe with your families secure
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Know you, the long scythe of destruction
   <br/>
   Has been sweeping the nations all around
   <br/>
   But it never yet cut with the keenness
   <br/>
   That it did on the eighteenth of June
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It began about five in the morning
   <br/>
   And it lasted 'til seven at night
   <br/>
   All the people stood 'round in amazement
   <br/>
   They had never yet seen such a sight
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And the thunder of five hundred cannons
   <br/>
   Proclaimed that the battle was on
   <br/>
   And the moon in the sky overshone all
   <br/>
   Recording the eighteenth of June
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And what a sad heart had poor Boney
   <br/>
   To take up instead of a crown
   <br/>
   And to canter from Brussels to Paris
   <br/>
   Lamenting the eighteenth of June
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   All you young girls with sweethearts out yonder
   <br/>
   That go daily to buy the black gown
   <br/>
   'Tis one thousand to one I will lay you
   <br/>
   Your love fell on the eighteenth of June
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Sixty thousand stout-hearted brave soldiers
   <br/>
   Who died made an awful bold tune
   <br/>
   And it's many's the girl will remember
   <br/>
   With sorrow the eighteenth of June
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And what a sad heart had poor Boney
   <br/>
   To take up instead of a crown
   <br/>
   And it's many's the girl will remember
   <br/>
   With sorrow the eighteenth of June
  </p>
