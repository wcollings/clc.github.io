   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    A soldier came knocking upon the queen's door
    <br/>
    He said, "I am not fighting for you anymore"
    <br/>
    And the queen knew she'd seen his face some place before
    <br/>
    And slowly she let him inside
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    He said, "I've watched your palace up here on the hill
    <br/>
    And I've wondered who's the woman for whom we all kill
    <br/>
    But I'm leaving tomorrow, you can do what you will
    <br/>
    Only first I am asking you why"
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    And down the long, narrow hall he was led
    <br/>
    Into her room with her tapestries red
    <br/>
    And she never once took the crown from her head
    <br/>
    She asked him then to sit down
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    He said, "I see you now, and you are so very young
    <br/>
    But I've seen more battles lost than I have battles won
    <br/>
    And I've got this intuition, says it's all for your fun
    <br/>
    And now, would you tell me why?"
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    Well, the young queen, she fixed him with an arrogant eye
    <br/>
    She said, "You won't understand and you may as well not try"
    <br/>
    But her face was a child's, and he thought she would cry
    <br/>
    Then she closed herself up like a fan
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    And she said, "I have swallowed a secret burning thread
    <br/>
    It cuts me inside, and it's often I've bled"
    <br/>
    And he laid his hand then on the top of her head
    <br/>
    And he bowed her down to the ground
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    "Tell me how hungry are you, how weak you must feel
    <br/>
    As you are living here alone, and you're never revealed
    <br/>
    But I won't march again on your battlefield"
    <br/>
    And he took her to the window to see
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    And the sun, it was gold, though the sky, it was gray
    <br/>
    And she wanted more than she ever could say
    <br/>
    But she knew how it frightened her and she turned away
    <br/>
    And would not look at his face again
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    And he said, "I want to live as an honest man
    <br/>
    To get all I deserve and to give all I can
    <br/>
    To love a young woman who I don't understand
    <br/>
    Your Highness, your ways are very strange"
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    But the crown, it had fallen, and he thought she would break
    <br/>
    She stood there ashamed of the way her heart ached
    <br/>
    And he took her to the doorway, she asked him to wait
    <br/>
    She would only be a moment inside
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    And out in the distance her order was heard
    <br/>
    And the soldier was killed still waiting for her word
    <br/>
    While the queen went on strangling in the solitude she preferred
    <br/>
    A battle raged on
   </font>
  </p>
