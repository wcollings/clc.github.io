  <p align="center">
   A soldier came knocking upon the queen's door
   <br/>
   He said, "I am not fighting for you anymore"
   <br/>
   And the queen knew she'd seen his face some place before
   <br/>
   And slowly she let him inside
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He said, "I've watched your palace up here on the hill
   <br/>
   And I've wondered who's the woman for whom we all kill
   <br/>
   But I'm leaving tomorrow, you can do what you will
   <br/>
   Only first I am asking you why"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And down the long, narrow hall he was led
   <br/>
   Into her room with her tapestries red
   <br/>
   And she never once took the crown from her head
   <br/>
   She asked him then to sit down
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He said, "I see you now, and you are so very young
   <br/>
   But I've seen more battles lost than I have battles won
   <br/>
   And I've got this intuition, says it's all for your fun
   <br/>
   And now, would you tell me why?"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, the young queen, she fixed him with an arrogant eye
   <br/>
   She said, "You won't understand and you may as well not try"
   <br/>
   But her face was a child's, and he thought she would cry
   <br/>
   Then she closed herself up like a fan
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And she said, "I have swallowed a secret burning thread
   <br/>
   It cuts me inside, and it's often I've bled"
   <br/>
   And he laid his hand then on the top of her head
   <br/>
   And he bowed her down to the ground
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Tell me how hungry are you, how weak you must feel
   <br/>
   As you are living here alone, and you're never revealed
   <br/>
   But I won't march again on your battlefield"
   <br/>
   And he took her to the window to see
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And the sun, it was gold, though the sky, it was gray
   <br/>
   And she wanted more than she ever could say
   <br/>
   But she knew how it frightened her and she turned away
   <br/>
   And would not look at his face again
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And he said, "I want to live as an honest man
   <br/>
   To get all I deserve and to give all I can
   <br/>
   To love a young woman who I don't understand
   <br/>
   Your Highness, your ways are very strange"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But the crown, it had fallen, and he thought she would break
   <br/>
   She stood there ashamed of the way her heart ached
   <br/>
   And he took her to the doorway, she asked him to wait
   <br/>
   She would only be a moment inside
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And out in the distance her order was heard
   <br/>
   And the soldier was killed still waiting for her word
   <br/>
   While the queen went on strangling in the solitude she preferred
   <br/>
   A battle raged on
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
