<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
A soldier came knocking upon the queen's door<br>
He said, "I am not fighting for you anymore"<br>
And the queen knew she'd seen his face some place before<br>
And slowly she let him inside</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
He said, "I've watched your palace up here on the hill<br>
And I've wondered who's the woman for whom we all kill<br>
But I'm leaving tomorrow, you can do what you will<br>
Only first I am asking you why"</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
And down the long, narrow hall he was led<br>
Into her room with her tapestries red<br>
And she never once took the crown from her head<br>
She asked him then to sit down</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
He said, "I see you now, and you are so very young<br>
But I've seen more battles lost than I have battles won<br>
And I've got this intuition, says it's all for your fun<br>
And now, would you tell me why?"</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
Well, the young queen, she fixed him with an arrogant eye<br>
She said, "You won't understand and you may as well not try"<br>
But her face was a child's, and he thought she would cry<br>
Then she closed herself up like a fan</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
And she said, "I have swallowed a secret burning thread<br>
It cuts me inside, and it's often I've bled"<br>
And he laid his hand then on the top of her head<br>
And he bowed her down to the ground</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
"Tell me how hungry are you, how weak you must feel<br>
As you are living here alone, and you're never revealed<br>
But I won't march again on your battlefield"<br>
And he took her to the window to see</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
And the sun, it was gold, though the sky, it was gray<br>
And she wanted more than she ever could say<br>
But she knew how it frightened her and she turned away<br>
And would not look at his face again</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
And he said, "I want to live as an honest man<br>
To get all I deserve and to give all I can<br>
To love a young woman who I don't understand<br>
Your Highness, your ways are very strange"</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
But the crown, it had fallen, and he thought she would break<br>
She stood there ashamed of the way her heart ached<br>
And he took her to the doorway, she asked him to wait<br>
She would only be a moment inside</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
And out in the distance her order was heard<br>
And the soldier was killed still waiting for her word<br>
While the queen went on strangling in the solitude she preferred<br>
A battle raged on</font></p></body>
