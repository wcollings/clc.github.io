  <p align="center">
   Cooler at the edge
   <br/>
   Longing for the green
   <br/>
   Cooler back where you come from
   <br/>
   And you survive, you survive
   <br/>
   But you're not alive
   <br/>
   Slower back where you come from
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Better off, but lonely
   <br/>
   Foreign streets are so straight
   <br/>
   And oh to be understood
   <br/>
   But go back home, that's what they say, go
   <br/>
   Oh but they don't have to know you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It's the pull of the moon, full rising
   <br/>
   The power of the tide going out
   <br/>
   And it holds you forever
   <br/>
   Even if you never go home
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Café, laughing strangers
   <br/>
   Cooler kind of smile
   <br/>
   They've got a different, a different sense of humor
   <br/>
   And try as you can, you just can't get inside
   <br/>
   And oh that distance you can't hide
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It's the pull of the moon, full rising
   <br/>
   The power of the tide going out
   <br/>
   And it holds you forever
   <br/>
   Even if you never go home
   <br/>
   (2x)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Even if you never go home...
