   I once loved a boy, and a bonnie, bonnie boy
   <br/>
   Who would come and go at my request
   <br/>
   I loved him so well, and so very, very well
   <br/>
   That I built him a bower in my breast
   <br/>
   In my breast
   <br/>
   That I built him a bower in my breast
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I once loved a boy, and a bonnie, bonnie boy
   <br/>
   And I boy that I thought was my own
   <br/>
   But he loves another girl better than me
   <br/>
   And has taken his flight and has gone
   <br/>
   And has gone
   <br/>
   He has taken his flight and has gone
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   That girl that has taken my own bonnie boy
   <br/>
   Let her make of him all that she can
   <br/>
   For whether he loves me or he loves me not
   <br/>
   I will walk with my love now and then
   <br/>
   Now and then
   <br/>
   I will walk with my love now and then
   <br/>
   (2x)
