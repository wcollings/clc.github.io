  <p align="center">
   As I roved out near Chester city
   <br/>
   In the dark all late at night
   <br/>
   Who should I see but a fair young maiden
   <br/>
   Washing her clothes by the fair moon light
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus (after each verse)
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Madam, I'm a darling, a di ro, a dither o
   <br/>
   Madam, I'm a darling, a di ro dae
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   First she washed them, then she squeezed them
   <br/>
   And then she hung them out to dry
   <br/>
   Then she folded up her arms
   <br/>
   Saying what a nice, young man am I
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Going to the well for a pale of water
   <br/>
   Fetching it home for to make some tea
   <br/>
   She fell under, I fell over
   <br/>
   All the game was above her knee
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Madam, I will tie your garter
   <br/>
   And I will tie it above your knee
   <br/>
   And if you like I'll tie it up further
   <br/>
   Madam, I'm a darling, a di ro de
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Have you ever heard of cups and saucers
   <br/>
   Rattlin' in an auld tin can?
   <br/>
   Have you ever heard of a fair, young maiden
   <br/>
   Married to an ugly, gray old man?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Madam, you have gold and silver
   <br/>
   And madam, you have tracks of land
   <br/>
   Madam you have ships on the ocean
   <br/>
   All you need is a fine, young man
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
