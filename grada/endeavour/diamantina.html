   The faces in the photograph are faded
   <br/>
   And I can't believe he looks so much like me
   <br/>
   For it's been ten long years today since I left for old Cork Station
   <br/>
   And I won't be back 'til the drovin's done
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   For the rain never falls on the dusty Diamantina
   <br/>
   The drover finds it hard to change his mind
   <br/>
   For the years have surely gone like the drays from old Cork Station
   <br/>
   And I won't be back 'til the drovin's done
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It seems like the sun comes up each morning
   <br/>
   Sets me up and then takes it all away
   <br/>
   For the dreaming by the light of the campfire at night
   <br/>
   Blends with the burning light of day
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And the rain never falls on the Dusty Diamantina
   <br/>
   The drover finds it hard to change his mind
   <br/>
   For the years have surely gone like the drays from old Cork Station
   <br/>
   And I won't be back 'til the drovin's done
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I sometimes think I'll settle back in Sydney
   <br/>
   But it's been so long and it's hard to change your mind
   <br/>
   For the cattle trays go on and on, and the fences roll forever
   <br/>
   And I won't be back 'til the drovin's done
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus 2x)
  </p>
