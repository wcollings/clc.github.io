  <p align="center">
   The sun rose in the year of seventeen sixty-nine
   <br/>
   If you looked up you'd have seen a ship out to sea
   <br/>
   With a masthead like never seen
   <br/>
   It was clear they were not from these seas
   <br/>
   They were sailing on a ship called Endeavour
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Six months traveling to their dream land
   <br/>
   Or so it's been told
   <br/>
   Trees full of flowers and the golden sand
   <br/>
   Gradient of every degree
   <br/>
   And no, this is not what they came to see
   <br/>
   Most were seeking rewards for their endeavours
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Step out, it makes your heart burn
   <br/>
   How flames scorched the land
   <br/>
   Like creatures tearing up what remained
   <br/>
   But who can say it would have been better
   <br/>
   Or it would have been the same
   <br/>
   Without the sailing of the Endeavour
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
