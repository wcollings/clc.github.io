  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She's like a swallow that flies so high
   <br/>
   Like a river that never runs dry
   <br/>
   She's like the sunshine on the Lee shore
   <br/>
   She loves her love, and the love is no more
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Out in the meadow this fair maid did go
   <br/>
   Picking the lovely primrose
   <br/>
   The more she plucked and the more she pulled
   <br/>
   Until she's got her apron full
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She climbed on yonder hill above
   <br/>
   To give a rose unto her love
   <br/>
   She gave him one, she gave him three
   <br/>
   She gave her heart for company
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And as they sat on yonder hill
   <br/>
   His heart grew hard, so harder still
   <br/>
   He has two hearts instead of one
   <br/>
   She says, "Young man, what have you done?"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   How foolish, foolish you must be
   <br/>
   To think I loved no one but thee
   <br/>
   The world's not made for one alone
   <br/>
   I take delight in everyone
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
