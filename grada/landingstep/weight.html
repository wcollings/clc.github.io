  <p align="center">
   She won't recover from her losses
   <br/>
   She's not chosen this path, but she watches who it crosses
   <br/>
   Maybe move to the right, maybe move to the left
   <br/>
   So we can all see the pain she wears like a banner on her chest
   <br/>
   We all say it's sad and we think it's a shame
   <br/>
   She's called to our attention, but we do not call her name
   <br/>
   The girl with the weight of the world in her hands
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   'Cause we're busy with our happiness, we're busy with our plans
   <br/>
   I wonder if alone she wants it taken from her hands
   <br/>
   But if things didn't keep getting harder
   <br/>
   She might miss her sacred chance to go a consecrated matyr
   <br/>
   The girl with the weight of the world in her hands
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I wonder which saint that lives inside a bead
   <br/>
   Will grant her consolation as she counts upon her knees
   <br/>
   It makes us all angry, though we fail to care
   <br/>
   But who will be the scale to weigh the cross she has to bear?
   <br/>
   The girl with the weight of the world in her hands
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Is the glass half-full or empty?" I ask her as I fill it
   <br/>
   She said, "It doesn't really matter, pretty soon you're bound to spill it"
   <br/>
   With the half-hearted language of the sermon she delivers
   <br/>
   The way she smiles so knowingly, it near gives me the shivers
   <br/>
   I pull the blanket higher, when I'm finally safe at home
   <br/>
   And she'll take a hundred with her, but she always sleeps alone
   <br/>
   The girl with the weight of the world in her hands
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I wonder which saint that lives inside a bead
   <br/>
   Will grant her consolation as she counts upon her knees
   <br/>
   It makes us all angry, though we fail to care
   <br/>
   But who will be the scale to weigh the cross she has to bear
   <br/>
   The girl with the weight of the world in her hands
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
