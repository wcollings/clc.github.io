   Mary, you may have to run
   <br/>
   You may have to be on your way
   <br/>
   Consider the things that you've done
   <br/>
   Mary, you may have to run
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Remember your tales and your lies
   <br/>
   They'll come back to haunt you one day
   <br/>
   And all of the boys you made cry
   <br/>
   Will remember your tales and your lies
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Your false heart can never be true
   <br/>
   I know it as well as the rest
   <br/>
   You pay dear for the things that you do
   <br/>
   Your false heart can never be true
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   One day the tables will turn
   <br/>
   Sooner than later, my dear
   <br/>
   And just like the bridges you've burned
   <br/>
   One day the tables will turn
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Just leave when the sun has gone down
   <br/>
   Pack up your wiles and your spells
   <br/>
   'Cause everything comes back around
   <br/>
   Just leave when the sun has gone down
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Mary, you may have to run
   <br/>
   You may have to be on your way
   <br/>
   Consider the things that you've done
   <br/>
   Mary, you may have to run
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   With all of the things that you've done
   <br/>
   Mary, you may have to run
  </p>
