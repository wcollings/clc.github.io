  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Over Annach Mór bog rises Nephin Mór mountain
   <br/>
   Between them, Lough Conn and the winding River Moy
   <br/>
   Beyond them lie Achill and the broad Atlantic Ocean
   <br/>
   To my back, Sliabh Gamph where I rambled as a boy
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There in the middle of a midsummer's evening
   <br/>
   I see all the geese and the crows flocking home
   <br/>
   When a ball of red fire sinks down behind Nephin
   <br/>
   Putting itself out on the wild Atlantic foam
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Carts crackle and crank behind cross-eyed asses
   <br/>
   Carrying their poor masters to tea and to rest
   <br/>
   When a clamor of a working day now is at an ending
   <br/>
   And the sinking sun disappears down in the west
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I sat cross-legged playing an old accordian
   <br/>
   In the middle of a field that was facing the bog
   <br/>
   Playing slow airs that no one's ever heard of
   <br/>
   And the cold River Moy covers Nepin in fog
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The back of beyond is a place where I love to be
   <br/>
   Far from New York City, the concrete and pain
   <br/>
   Where the air, it is so clean, and people are astounding
   <br/>
   It's there that my thoughts and dreams will remain
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Over Annach Mór bog rises Nephin Mór mountain
   <br/>
   Between them, Lough Conn and the winding River Moy
   <br/>
   Beyond them lie Achill and the broad Atlantic Ocean
   <br/>
   To my back, Sliabh Gamph where I rambled as a boy
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
