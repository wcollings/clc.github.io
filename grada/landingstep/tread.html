    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Tread softly, for she is near under the snow
   <br/>
   Speak gently, for she can hear your daisies grow
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   All of her bright and golden hair was tarnished with rust
   <br/>
   She that was young and fair has fallen to dust
   <br/>
   Has fallen to dust
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She was lily-like and white as snow
   <br/>
   Never knew she was a woman so sweetly she grew
   <br/>
   Yet a coffin board and a heavy stone lie upon her breast
   <br/>
   And I vex my heart alone that she is at rest
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Not the tribune's voice nor the poet's pen
   <br/>
   May sow such seeds in slavorous men
   <br/>
   'Tis the soldier's sword alone that may reap such harvest
   <br/>
   When they have grown, when they have grown
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Peace, she cannot hear a line, nor a tune, nor a song, nor a sonnet
   <br/>
   My life is buried here, heap of earth upon it
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus 2x)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Tread softly, for she is near
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
