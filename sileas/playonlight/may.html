  <p align="center">
   False sir John a-wooing came to a maid of beauty rare
   <br/>
   May Colvin was her name, her father's only heir
   <br/>
   We wooed her but he wooed her ben, he wooed her in the hall
   <br/>
   'Til he's gotten her consent to mount and ride awa'
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   They've gone down to her father's bower where all the steeds did stand
   <br/>
   There they've chosen her father's horse, the best that's in the land
   <br/>
   He's got on and she's got on, swiftly they did flee
   <br/>
   'Til they came to a lonely spot, a rock by the side of the sea
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Get down, get down, May Colvin, your bridal here you see
   <br/>
   I have drowned seven young ladies and the eighth one you shall be
   <br/>
   Cast off, cast off, May Colvin, all and your silken gown
   <br/>
   It's ow'er good and costly to rot in the salt sea foam
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Cast off, cast off, May Colvin, all and your silver shune
   <br/>
   They're ow'er good and costly to rot in the salt sea foam
   <br/>
   Turn around, false sir John, and look to the leaf o' the tree
   <br/>
   For it ne'er became a gentleman a naked lady to see
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He's turned himself around and about and he's looked to the leaf of the tree
   <br/>
   So swiftly did May Colvin cast him into the sea
   <br/>
   Help, oh help, May Colvin, oh help or else I'll drown
   <br/>
   I'll take you back to your father's bower and set you down safe and sound
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   No help, no help, false sir John, no help, though I pity thee
   <br/>
   Seven young ladies you have drowned and the eighth one won't be me
   <br/>
   She's got onto her milk-white steed, swiftly rode away
   <br/>
   She's come home to her father's bower before the break of the day
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
 </body>
