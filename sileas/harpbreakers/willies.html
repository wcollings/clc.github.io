   Oh Willie's fair and Willie's rare
   <br/>
   And Willie's wondrous bonnie
   <br/>
   And Willie hecht tae marry me
   <br/>
   Gin e'er he married ony
   <br/>
   Gin e'er he married ony
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Yestreen I mad' my bed fu' braid
   <br/>
   This nicht I'll mak it narrow
   <br/>
   For 'a the lee lang winter's nicht
   <br/>
   I'll lie twined o' my marrow
   <br/>
   I'll lie twined o' my marrow
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh cam ye by yon waterside
   <br/>
   Pu'd ye the rose or lily
   <br/>
   Or cam ye by yon meadow green
   <br/>
   Or saw ye my sweet Willie
   <br/>
   Or saw ye my sweet Willie
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She socht him east, she socht him west
   <br/>
   She soucht him braid and narrow
   <br/>
   And in the cliftin' o' a crag
   <br/>
   She found him drooned in Yarrow
   <br/>
   She found him drooned in Yarrow
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Her hair, it was five quarters lang
   <br/>
   The color, it was yellow
   <br/>
   She's tied it roond his middle sae sma'
   <br/>
   And pu'd him oot o' Yarrow
   <br/>
   She's pu'd him oot o' Yarrow
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh mither mak my bed this nicht
   <br/>
   Oh mak it lang and narrow
   <br/>
   For ne'er a man shall lie by my side
   <br/>
   Since Willie's drooned in Yarrow
   <br/>
   Since Willie's drooned in Yarrow
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
