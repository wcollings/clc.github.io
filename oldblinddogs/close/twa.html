  <p align="center">
   As I was walking, oh a' my lane
   <br/>
   I spied twa corbies, they were makin' mane
   <br/>
   And een ontae the other did say
   <br/>
   "Where will we gang? Will we dine the day?
   <br/>
   Where will we gang? Will we dine the day?"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It's in ahind yon oul fail dyke
   <br/>
   I wot there lies, oh a new-slain knight
   <br/>
   Naebody kens that he lies there
   <br/>
   But his hawk, his hound and his lady fair
   <br/>
   His hawk, his hound and his lady fair
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   His hawk is tae the hunting gane
   <br/>
   His hound, to bring a' wild fowl hame
   <br/>
   His lady's ta'en another mate
   <br/>
   So we can mak' our dinner sweet
   <br/>
   So we can mak' our dinner sweet
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It's you'll sit on his white horse bane
   <br/>
   And I'll pick out his bonny blue e'en
   <br/>
   Wi' a lock of his gowden hair
   <br/>
   We'll thak our nest fan it grows bare
   <br/>
   We'll thak our nest fan it grows bare
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There's mony's an ane now for him makes mane
   <br/>
   But naebody kens where he has gane
   <br/>
   Through his bare bones as they lie bare
   <br/>
   The wind will blow aye forever mare
   <br/>
   The wind will blow aye forever mare
  </p>
