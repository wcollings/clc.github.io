  <p align="center">
   There were four and twenty nobles fasted at the king's ha'
   <br/>
   And bonnie Glenlogie was the flo'er o' them a'
   <br/>
   There were nine and nine nobles rade thro' Banchory fair
   <br/>
   Aye, bonnie Glenlogie was the flo'er o' them there
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There were six and six maidens fasted at the king's ha'
   <br/>
   Bonnie Jean o' Bethelnie was the flo'er o' them a'
   <br/>
   Doon cam' Jeannie Gordon, she cam' trippin' doon the stair
   <br/>
   She's chosen Glenlogie o' a' that was there
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Glenlogie, Glenlogie, gin ye'll prove sae kind
   <br/>
   My love is laid upon you, I've tell'd ye my mind"
   <br/>
   He's turnin' 'roon lightly as the Gordons does a'
   <br/>
   "I'm sorry, Jeannie Gordon, I'm promised awa'"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So he's ca'ed tae her maidens for tae make her a bed
   <br/>
   Aye wi' ribbons an' wi' napkins tae tie up her heid
   <br/>
   An' it's up an' spak' her faither, well a wae man wis he
   <br/>
   "I'll wad ye tae Dunfermline, he's mair gowd than he"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Ye haud your tongue, faither, for this winna be
   <br/>
   Gin I get me Glenlogie, for him will I dee"
   <br/>
   Her faither's ain chaplain, he's a man o' great skill
   <br/>
   He's write a braid letter, and indited him weel
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Saying, "A pox on ye, Logie, noo sin' it is so
   <br/>
   There's a lady's love laid on ye, must she'll die in her woe?
   <br/>
   An' a pox on ye, Logie, noo sin' it is time
   <br/>
   There's a lady's love laid on ye, must she die in her prime?"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When Glenlogie's got the letter, him bein' amangst men
   <br/>
   Ach, it's up an' spak' Glenlogie, "What does young women mean?"
   <br/>
   Then he looked at the letter, a light lauch gied he
   <br/>
   Aye, but e'er he read ower it, a tear blint his e'e
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Saddle me the black horse, saddle me the broon
   <br/>
   Bonnie Jeannie o' Bethelnie will be deid e'er I win"
   <br/>
   But the horses wisnae saddled, nor led on the green
   <br/>
   Aye, an' bonnie Glenlogie was twelve miles his lane
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It was pale and wan was she when Glenlogie cam' in
   <br/>
   But was red and rosy grew she when she kent it was him
   <br/>
   "Whaur lies your pain, lady? Does it lie in your side?
   <br/>
   Whaur lies your pain, lady? Does in lie in your heid?"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Oh no, no, Glenlogie, you're far frae the pairt
   <br/>
   For the pain that ye speak of, oh it lies in my heart"
   <br/>
   "Turn 'roon, Jeannie Gordon, turn 'roon on your side
   <br/>
   It's I'll be the bridegroom, ye'll be the bride"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh noo Jeannie's gotten mairried and her tocher doon told
   <br/>
   Bonnie Jean o' Bethelnie was scarce sixteen years auld
   <br/>
   Bethelnie, oh Bethelnie, ye shine whaur ye stand
   <br/>
   And the heather bells aroon ye shine ower Fyvie's land
  </p>
