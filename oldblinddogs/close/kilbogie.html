  <p align="center">
   Fan first he cam' tae Kilbogie toon
   <br/>
   Wi' his wee short coat and his tartan plaidie
   <br/>
   First fan he cam' his bonnie lassie tae see
   <br/>
   She lay in her bed 'til the breakfast was ready
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She said she __ oot into the fields
   <br/>
   Oot into the fields along wi' her daddy
   <br/>
   But fine kent he by __ hand
   <br/>
   She lay in her bed 'til the breakfast was ready
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh fan the breakfast was laid oot
   <br/>
   It was laid oot and gotten ready
   <br/>
   Up spake her mither untae her
   <br/>
   "Hae nothin' tae dae wi' a Hielan' laddie"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So they baith gaed oot tae tak' a walk
   <br/>
   Tae tak' a walk 'til the dinner was ready
   <br/>
   He heisted her up on his high horse's back
   <br/>
   An' she's far far awa' frae her hame in Kilbogie
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Fan it's first tae the Heilan's they cam'
   <br/>
   There was nothin' there fittin' for a lady
   <br/>
   There was naebody there tae welcome her hame
   <br/>
   But an' auld cankered carl and an auld doited wifey
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, the teen, he ca'd her Lawlan Jean
   <br/>
   An' the tither, she ca'd her Lawlan Jennie
   <br/>
   But she's ca'd them a far better thing
   <br/>
   It's ma' Heilan daddy an' ma' Heilan mamie
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh fan at last tae the Hielan's they cam'
   <br/>
   There was nothin' there fittin' for a lady
   <br/>
   Nothin' there tae lay doon upon
   <br/>
   But a wee pickle heather an' his tartan plaidie
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "In my faither's hoose there's blankets and sheets
   <br/>
   An' they're all laid oot and gotten ready
   <br/>
   Very, very angry wad he be
   <br/>
   Tae see me lyin' here on yer tartan plaidie"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "In the Hielan's we've got flocks o' sheep
   <br/>
   An' they are very thick and bonnie
   <br/>
   An' ye'll get wool an' ye can spin
   <br/>
   An' mak' ye a blanket instead o' a plaidie"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Oor sheep are guid and guid eneuch
   <br/>
   But barley rigs are better bonnie
   <br/>
   They'll stand up tae the wind and the rain
   <br/>
   Fan yer sheep, they'll be in the wintery weather"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "A carriage and horses ye will prepare"
   <br/>
   A carriage and horses was gotten ready
   <br/>
   A carriage and horses tae carry her awa'
   <br/>
   An' she's back tae her hame in Kilbogie
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
 </body>
