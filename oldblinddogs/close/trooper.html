  <p align="center">
   A trooper lad came here __
   <br/>
   Frae riding he was weary
   <br/>
   A trooper lad came here __
   <br/>
   And the moon was shining clearly
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus (after each verse)
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Lassie, I'll lie near ye yet
   <br/>
   Bonnie lassie, I'll lie near ye
   <br/>
   And I'll gar all your ribbons reel
   <br/>
   In the morning 'ere I leave ye
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She's ta'en the trooper by the hand
   <br/>
   And led him tae the chamber
   <br/>
   She's gi'en him breid and wine tae drink
   <br/>
   And his love, it flared like tinder
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She's made her bed both wide and lang
   <br/>
   Made it like a lady
   <br/>
   She's pu'ed her petticoats o'er her heid
   <br/>
   Crying, "Trooper, are ye ready?"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He's ta'en off his big top coat
   <br/>
   Likewise his hat and feather
   <br/>
   He's ta'en his broadsword frae his side
   <br/>
   Oh an' he's laid doon aside her
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The trumpet sounds at Burreldales
   <br/>
   Sayin' man and horse mak' ready
   <br/>
   The drums are beat at __ Hill
   <br/>
   Lads, leave yer mams and daddys
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The fifes do play at __
   <br/>
   Let's leave the __ o' Fyvie
   <br/>
   The trooper tae the fair maid said
   <br/>
   "Bonnie lassie, I maun leave ye"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Fan will ye come back again?
   <br/>
   An' fan will we marry?"
   <br/>
   "Fan frost __
   <br/>
   Oh it's then I will na tarry"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She's pu'ed her coatie o'er her head
   <br/>
   An' followed him doon thro' Stirling
   <br/>
   But she grew so fu' that she could na bow
   <br/>
   And he's left her in Dunferline
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Cheese and breid for girls and dames
   <br/>
   Corn and hay for horses
   <br/>
   Aye cups o' tea is for auld wives
   <br/>
   Aye an' lads for bonnie lassies
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
