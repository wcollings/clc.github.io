   Tibbie Fowler o' the glen, there's ower mony wooin' at her
   <br/>
   Tibbie Fowler o' the glen, there's ower mony wooin' at her
   <br/>
   Ten cam' east and ten cam' west and ten cam' sailin' ower the watter
   <br/>
   Twa cam' doon yon lang dyke side, there's ower mony wooin' at her
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus (after each verse)
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Wooin' at her, pu'in at her
   <br/>
   Wantin' her, canna get her
   <br/>
   Silly elf, it's for her pelf
   <br/>
   A' the lads are wooin' at her
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Seven but and seven ben, aye seven in the pantry wi' her
   <br/>
   Twenty heid aroon' the door, there's ower mony wooin' at her
   <br/>
   She's got pendles in her lugs, aye cockle shells would set her better
   <br/>
   High-heeled sheen wi' siller tags and a' the lads are wooin' at her
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Be a lassie 'ere sae black o' gin she hid the penny siller
   <br/>
   Set her up on Tintock Tap, the wind will blaw a minnie 'til her
   <br/>
   Be a lassie 'ere sae fair o' gin she hid the penny siller
   <br/>
   A flea would fell her in the air afore a man was even 'til her
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Tibbie Fowler o' the glen, there's ower mony wooin' at her
   <br/>
   Tibbie Fowler o' the glen, there's ower mony wooin' at her
  </p>
