  <p align="center">
   Oh lass, gin' ye would think it right
   <br/>
   Tae gyang wi' me this very night
   <br/>
   We'll cuddle tae the mornin' light
   <br/>
   By a' the lave unseen O
   <br/>
   And ye will be my dearie
   <br/>
   My ain dearest dearie
   <br/>
   It's ye will be my dearie
   <br/>
   Gin ye meet me at e'en O
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I canna for my mammy gae
   <br/>
   She locks the door and keeps the key
   <br/>
   And in the mornin' charges me
   <br/>
   And aye aboot the men O
   <br/>
   For she says they're a' deceivers
   <br/>
   Deceivers, deceivers
   <br/>
   She says they're a' deceivers
   <br/>
   Ye canna trust ane O
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh nivver min' yer mammy's yell
   <br/>
   Nae doot she met yer dad hersel'
   <br/>
   And should she flyte, ye can tell her
   <br/>
   She's aft times done the same O
   <br/>
   So lassie, gie's yer hand on't
   <br/>
   Yer bonnie milk-white hand on't
   <br/>
   Lassie, gie's yer hand on't
   <br/>
   And scorn tae lie yer lane O
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh lad, my haun' I canna gi'e
   <br/>
   But aiblins I man steal the key
   <br/>
   And I'll meet ye at yon birkin tree
   <br/>
   That grows doon in the glen O
   <br/>
   But dinna lippen, laddie
   <br/>
   I canna promise, laddie
   <br/>
   Oh dinna lippen, laddie
   <br/>
   In case I canna win O
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So he's gaen tae the birkin tree
   <br/>
   In hopes his ain true tae see
   <br/>
   Fa come trippin' ower the lea
   <br/>
   But just his bonnie Jean O
   <br/>
   And she's clinkit doon beside him
   <br/>
   Beside him, beside him
   <br/>
   She's clinkit doon beside him
   <br/>
   Amangst the grass sae green O
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "I'm overjoyed wi' rapture noo"
   <br/>
   Quo' he, and preed his cherry moo'
   <br/>
   And Jeannie ne'er had cause tae rue
   <br/>
   That nicht upon the green O
   <br/>
   For she has got her Johnny
   <br/>
   Her ain lovin' Johnny
   <br/>
   It's she has got her Johnny
   <br/>
   And Johnny's got his Jean O
  </p>
