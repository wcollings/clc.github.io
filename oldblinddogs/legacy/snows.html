  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The snows, they melt the soonest when the wind begins to sing
   <br/>
   The corn, it ripens fastest when the frosts are settlin' in
   <br/>
   And when a lover tells me that my face she'll soon forget
   <br/>
   Before we part, I'll wage a crown she's bound to follow yet
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The snows, they melt the soonest when the wind begins to sing
   <br/>
   The swallow flies without a thought as long as it is spring
   <br/>
   But when spring goes and winter blows, my love, she will be fain
   <br/>
   For all her pride to follow me across the raging main
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The snows, they melt the soonest when the wind begins to sing
   <br/>
   The bee that flew when summer shone, in winter cannot sting
   <br/>
   I've seen a lover's anger melt between the night and the morn
   <br/>
   But it's surely not a harder thing to melt a woman's scorn
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So don't you bid me farewell, no farewell I'll receive
   <br/>
   For you will lie with me, my love, then kiss and take your leave
   <br/>
   I'll wait here 'til the moorcock calls, and the martin takes the wing
   <br/>
   For the snows, they melt the soonest when the winds begin to sing
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The snows, they melt the soonest when the winds begin to sing
   <br/>
   The corn, it ripens fastest when the frosts are settlin' in
   <br/>
   And when a lover tells me that my face she'll soon forget
   <br/>
   Before we part, I'll wage a crown she's bound to follow yet
  </p>
