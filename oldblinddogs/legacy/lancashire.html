  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It was last Monday morning
   <br/>
   Oh as I have heard them say
   <br/>
   Our orders, they came this afternoon
   <br/>
   We're bound to march away
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus (after each verse)
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   For the Lancashire lads have gone abroad
   <br/>
   Whatever shall we do?
   <br/>
   They're leaving many's a pretty fair maid
   <br/>
   To cry, "What shall I do?"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Said the mother to the daughter
   <br/>
   "What makes you talk so strange?
   <br/>
   That you want to marry a soldier lad
   <br/>
   And the whole wide world to range
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   For the soldiers, they are ramblin' boys
   <br/>
   They have but little pay
   <br/>
   Can they maintain a wife and child
   <br/>
   On fifteen pence day?"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Said the father to the daughter
   <br/>
   "I'll have you close confined
   <br/>
   You'll never marry a soldier lad
   <br/>
   He'll be no son of mine"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Oh if you confine me seven long years
   <br/>
   And after set me free
   <br/>
   I'll go and I'll follow m' soldier lad
   <br/>
   When I gain my liberty
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   For my true love's dressed in scarlet
   <br/>
   And turned up with the blue
   <br/>
   And every place that he goes in
   <br/>
   My sweetheart is true"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Now we've gotten sweethearts enough, brave boys
   <br/>
   Girls to please our minds
   <br/>
   But we'll never forget sweet Manchester
   <br/>
   And the girls we left behind
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
