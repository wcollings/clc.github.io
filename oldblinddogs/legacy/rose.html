   There was a woman lived in the north
   <br/>
   Hey wi' the rose and the lindsey O
   <br/>
   She has coorted her faither's clerk
   <br/>
   Doon by the Greenwood sidey O
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She's coorted him for a year and a day
   <br/>
   Hey wi' the rose and the lindsey O
   <br/>
   'Til her great belly did her betray
   <br/>
   Doon by the Greenwood sidey O
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She's leaned her back against a tree
   <br/>
   Hey wi' the rose and the lindsey O
   <br/>
   Thinkin' that she micht lichter be
   <br/>
   Doon by the Greenwood sidey O
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She's leaned her back against a thorn
   <br/>
   Hey wi' the rose and the lindsey O
   <br/>
   Bonnie's the boys that she has borne
   <br/>
   Doon by the Greenwood sidey O
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But she's taen oot her wee penknife
   <br/>
   Hey wi' the rose and the lindsey O
   <br/>
   And she has taen the bairnies' lives
   <br/>
   Doon by the Greenwood sidey O
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She's buried them 'neath a marble stane
   <br/>
   Hey wi' the rose and the lindsey O
   <br/>
   Thinkin' tae gang a maiden hame
   <br/>
   Doon by the Greenwood sidey O
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She was lookin' ower her faither's castle wa'
   <br/>
   Hey wi' the rose and the lindsey O
   <br/>
   She's spied her bonnie boys playin' at the ba'
   <br/>
   Doon by the Greenwood sidey O
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Oh bonnie bairns, gin ye were mine
   <br/>
   Hey wi' the rose and the lindsey O
   <br/>
   I'd dress ye up in silk sae fine"
   <br/>
   Doon by the Greenwood sidey O
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Oh mither dear, fan we were thine
   <br/>
   Hey wi' the rose and the lindsey O
   <br/>
   We nivver saw ocht o' the silk sae fine"
   <br/>
   Doon by the Greenwood sidey O
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Bonnie bairns, come tell tae me
   <br/>
   Hey wi' the rose and the lindsey O
   <br/>
   Fit kind o' death I'll hae tae dee"
   <br/>
   Doon by the Greenwood sidey O
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Seven years a bird in the wood
   <br/>
   Hey wi' the rose and the lindsey O
   <br/>
   Seven years a fish in flood
   <br/>
   Doon by the Greenwood sidey O
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And seven years at the warnin' bell
   <br/>
   Hey wi' the rose and the lindsey O
   <br/>
   Seven years in the depths o' hell"
   <br/>
   Doon by the Greenwood sidey O
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh welcome, welcome bird in the wood
   <br/>
   Hey wi' the rose and the lindsey O
   <br/>
   Welcome, welcome fish in the flood
   <br/>
   Doon by the Greenwood sidey O
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And welcome, welcome tae the warnin' bell
   <br/>
   Hey wi' the rose and the lindsey O
   <br/>
   God keep me oot o' the depths o' hell
