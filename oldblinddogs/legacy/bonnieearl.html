   Ye Heilan's and ye lowlands, whaur hae ye been?
   <br/>
   Ye hae slain the Earl o' Moray and laid him on the green
   <br/>
   He was a braw gallant, he played at the ball
   <br/>
   The bonnie Earl o' Moray was the floo'er amang them all
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And woe betide ye, Huntly, wherefore were ye, Tay
   <br/>
   I bad ye bring him tae ma, forbad ye him tae slay
   <br/>
   He was a braw gallant, he played at the ring
   <br/>
   The bonnie Earl o' Moray micht hae been the king
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Lang may his lady
   <br/>
   Look fae the castle Doune
   <br/>
   'Ere she sees the Earl o' Moray
   <br/>
   Gang soondin' through the toon
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Ye Heilan's and ye lowlands, whaur hae ye been?
   <br/>
   Ye hae slain the Earl o' Moray and laid him on the green
   <br/>
   He was a braw gallant, he played at the glove
   <br/>
   The bonnie Earl o' Moray, he was the queen's true love
