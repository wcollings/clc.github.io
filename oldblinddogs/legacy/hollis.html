  <p align="center">
   Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
   <br/>
   Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
   <br/>
   With his wife, his five children and his cabin broken down
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He looked for work and money and he walked a ragged mile
   <br/>
   He looked for work and money and he walked a ragged mile
   <br/>
   But your children are so hungry that they don't know how to smile
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The rats got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare
   <br/>
   The rats got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare
   <br/>
   Is there anyone that knows? Is there anyone who cares?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You prayed to the Lord above, oh please send you a friend
   <br/>
   You prayed to the Lord above, oh please send you a friend
   <br/>
   Your empty pockets tell you that you ain't got no friends
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're a-tuggin' at your sleeve
   <br/>
   Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're a-tuggin' at your sleeve
   <br/>
   You walk the floor, you wonder why with every breath you breathe
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well
   <br/>
   Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well
   <br/>
   You spent your lone last dollar on seven shotgun shells
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And away out in the wilderness a lone coyote calls
   <br/>
   Away out in the wilderness a lone coyote calls
   <br/>
   Your eyes fix on the shotgun that's a-hanging on the wall
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And your brain is a-bleedin', and your legs can't seem to stand
   <br/>
   Your brain is a-bleedin', and your legs can't seem to stand
   <br/>
   Your eyes fix on the shotgun that your holdin' in your hand
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There's seven breezes blowin' all around the cabin door
   <br/>
   There's seven breezes blowin' all around the cabin door
   <br/>
   Seven shots rang out like the ocean's pounding roar
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm
   <br/>
   There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm
   <br/>
   Somewhere in the distance there's seven new people born
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
