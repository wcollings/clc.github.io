  <p align="center">
   The heather will fade, aye bracken will die
   <br/>
   Streams will run cold and clear
   <br/>
   Aye the small birds will be going
   <br/>
   For it's then that you'll be knowing
   <br/>
   That the terror time is here
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The woods give no shelter, and the trees, they are bare
   <br/>
   Snows lying all around
   <br/>
   Oh the young children are crying
   <br/>
   For the bed on which they're lying
   <br/>
   Is frozen to the ground
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And when you need the warmth of your own human kind
   <br/>
   You move near a town and then
   <br/>
   Oh the sight of you is offending
   <br/>
   The police they soon are sending
   <br/>
   And you're on the road again
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Whaur will ye gang, aye and whit will ye dae?
   <br/>
   Noo that the work's all done
   <br/>
   And the fairmer doesnae need ye
   <br/>
   And the Cooncil willnae feed ye
   <br/>
   And you're on the road again
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Heather will fade, aye bracken will die
   <br/>
   The streams will run cold and clear
   <br/>
   Aye the small birds will be going
   <br/>
   For it's then that you'll be knowing
   <br/>
   That the terror time is here
  </p>
