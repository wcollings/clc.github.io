  </p>
  <p align="center">
   As I rode by yon Brig O Dye
   <br/>
   And past yon hill o' broom
   <br/>
   A maiden sang right merrily
   <br/>
   Just as the sun gaed doon
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus (after each verse)
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Sayin', "Cairn O' Mount is bleak and bare
   <br/>
   And cauld lies Clach na Benn
   <br/>
   And you can see the snow lyin' there
   <br/>
   Along the summer's end"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, I lighted off my dapple gray
   <br/>
   And walked by her side
   <br/>
   Sayin', "Lassie, I hae lost my way
   <br/>
   Upon your moor sae wide
   <br/>
   Oh war me o' your face sae fair
   <br/>
   Yer een sae bonny blue
   <br/>
   The longest day I blighthly share
   <br/>
   Tae kiss your cherry moo
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh lassie, will ye gan wi' me
   <br/>
   And leave yer cauld richt glen?
   <br/>
   Wi' a' my kin, ye'll bear the gree
   <br/>
   There's wealth baith but and ben
   <br/>
   Wi' silks and satins busket braw
   <br/>
   And ribbons fer yer hair
   <br/>
   And maids tae answer when ye ca'
   <br/>
   So can ye wish for mair?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh lassie, ye maun think a while
   <br/>
   My lands are far and wide
   <br/>
   I've gold in banks and ships at sea
   <br/>
   So come and be my bride
   <br/>
   My faither's left me lordships twa
   <br/>
   A coach at my command
   <br/>
   I'll mak' ye lady o' them a'
   <br/>
   If ye'll gie me yer hand
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh lassie, think yer Donald's poor
   <br/>
   Has neither horse nor coo
   <br/>
   A shepherd stragglin' ower the moor
   <br/>
   Is no' a match for you"
   <br/>
   "Oh Cairn O' Mount is bleak and bare
   <br/>
   And cauld lies Clach na Benn
   <br/>
   And I'd rather meet my Donald there
   <br/>
   Than be fair Scotland's Queen"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Oh lassie I'm loath tae tell
   <br/>
   You throw yer love awa'
   <br/>
   Yer Donald brally kens himsel'
   <br/>
   Last gloamins what I saw
   <br/>
   As I rode by his shielin' door
   <br/>
   I spied a heiland maid
   <br/>
   And yer Donald kissed her ower and ower
   <br/>
   And rolled her in his plaid"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Would you swear a solemn oath
   <br/>
   What you hae told tae me?
   <br/>
   I wouldnae dread my Donald's faith
   <br/>
   But sae base loon ye lee"
   <br/>
   It's he's thrown off his laland dress
   <br/>
   Combed doon his yellow hair
   <br/>
   Sayin', "Lassie, you've been true tae me
   <br/>
   And now we'll part nae mair
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Nae mair I'm shepherd o' the glen
   <br/>
   But laird a'yont the Dee
   <br/>
   And since ye hae been true tae me
   <br/>
   I'll aye prove true tae thee"
