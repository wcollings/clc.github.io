  <p align="center">
   Oh there came a letter yesterday
   <br/>
   Our ship, it will sail at morn
   <br/>
   "Alas," cried my bonny lass
   <br/>
   That ever I were born
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   And it's braw sailing on the sea
   <br/>
   When wind and weather's fair
   <br/>
   But it's better to be in my love's arms
   <br/>
   I wish that I were there
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So when he went to her farm house
   <br/>
   At twelve o'clock at noon
   <br/>
   The lassie being proud-hearted
   <br/>
   She would not let him in
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So she's taen the ring from her pocket
   <br/>
   It cost her shillings nine
   <br/>
   Saying, "Take this ring, my bonny lad
   <br/>
   For I have changed my mind"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So he's taen the ring from his pocket
   <br/>
   It cost him guineas three
   <br/>
   Saying, "Take this ring, my bonny lass
   <br/>
   And aye think well of me"
   <br/>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And it's braw drinking Glasgow beer
   <br/>
   It's better drinking wine
   <br/>
   But it's better to be in my love's arms
   <br/>
   Where I have been many's the time
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus 3x)
  </p>
