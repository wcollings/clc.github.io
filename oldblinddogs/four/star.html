  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh I'll sing you a stave if you'll gies your attention
   <br/>
   It's no song of pity, it's no tale of woe
   <br/>
   And no word of honor or love will I mention
   <br/>
   But I'll sing of a lassie I kent long ago
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   No better than most, and no worse as many
   <br/>
   And what drew me to her's no' easy to say
   <br/>
   She was course, she was heartless, and she wasnae that bonnie
   <br/>
   But she was the star o' the bar in her day
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I've stravaiged the Royal Mile with her, drinking in style with her
   <br/>
   And Rose Street from end to end often surveyed
   <br/>
   Fought and swore in the pubs with her, rolled in the dubs with her
   <br/>
   Cadged many's a sub from her never repaid
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   All you chaps with young lassies, believe me, love soon passes
   <br/>
   And all your bright dreams are but straws in the wind
   <br/>
   Better one who'll sit down with you, sing a fine tune with you
   <br/>
   Pass the glass 'round with you, drink herself blind
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus 2x)
  </p>
