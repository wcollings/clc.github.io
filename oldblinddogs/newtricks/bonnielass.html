   Well, there once was troop o' Irish dragoons
   <br/>
   Cam' marchin' doon through Fyvie O
   <br/>
   Captain's fa'en in love wi' anither bonnie quine
   <br/>
   Oh the name that she had was pretty Peggy O
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Oh come runnin' doon yer stairs, pretty Peggy, my dear
   <br/>
   Come runnin' doon yer stairs, pretty Peggy O
   <br/>
   Come runnin' doon yer stairs, tie back yer yellow hair
   <br/>
   Tak' a last fareweel tae yer daddie O
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, it's braw, it's braw captain's lady for tae be
   <br/>
   It's braw tae be a captain's lady O
   <br/>
   Braw tae rine and rant, aye tae follow wi' the camp
   <br/>
   Oh an' march when yer captain, he is ready O
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Now the colonel, he cried, "Mount, boys, mount, boys, mount"
   <br/>
   Oh the captain, he cried, "Tarry O
   <br/>
   Tarry for a while, for anither day or twa
   <br/>
   Just tae see if this bonnie lass will marry O"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh but syne e'er we cam' up tae Bethelnie toon
   <br/>
   Wir captain we had for tae carry O
   <br/>
   An' syne e'er we cam' up tae bonnie Aberdeen
   <br/>
   Oh wir captain we had for tae bury O
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, there's mony's a bonnie lassie in the howe o' Auchterless
   <br/>
   There's mony's a bonnie dame in the gearie O

   There's mony's a bonnie Jean in the toon o' Aberdeen
   <br/>
   But the flo'er o' them a' bides in Fyvie O
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, it's green grow the birks on bonnie Ythan side
   <br/>
   An' low lie the Lowlands o' Fyvie O

   <br/>
   Oh he died for the sodger lass o' Fyvie
  </p>

   Aye, there once was troop o' Irish dragoons
   <br/>
   Cam' marchin' doon through Fyvie O
   <br/>
   And the captain's fa'en in love wi' anither bonnie quine
