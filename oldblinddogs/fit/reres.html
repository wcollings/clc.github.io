  <p align="center">
   Last year at Lady Mary's Fair when I was on the spree
   <br/>
   I fell in wi' an auld sweetheart, a weaver frae Dundee
   <br/>
   Her company I sought and won, and with her I did go
   <br/>
   But I'll hing my heid in shame to say I proved her overthrow
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We wandered east, we wandered west, we wandered roond the law
   <br/>
   I said I'd see her hame that night, but hame we never saw
   <br/>
   I kept beside her all the while, resolved tae hae my will
   <br/>
   And by and by we lost our wye at the back o' Reres Hill
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Noo fan we cam tae Reres Hill a thocht did come to me
   <br/>
   "We can't go home tonight, my dear, it's far over late, ye see
   <br/>
   But the night is warm and in my pooch I hae anither gill
   <br/>
   So we can lie doon here content at the back o' Reres Hill"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I poured anither nip apiece, tae quieten her alarm
   <br/>
   And fan we awoke next mornin' we were locked in each other's arms
   <br/>
   She handed me the bottle anither glass tae fill
   <br/>
   And she drank my health and store o' wealth at the back o' Reres Hill
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Now may I never prosper and may I never thrive
   <br/>
   In anything I take in hand as lang as I'm alive
   <br/>
   If e'er I cause that lass tae rue the day I had my will
   <br/>
   Success tae Lady Mary's Fair and the back o' Reres Hill
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
