   Is there for honest poverty
   <br/>
   That hings his head an' a' that?
   <br/>
   The coward slave, we pass him by
   <br/>
   We dare be poor for a' that
   <br/>
   For a' that, an' a' that
   <br/>
   Our toils obscure an' a' that
   <br/>
   The rank is but the guinea's stamp
   <br/>
   The man's the gowd for a' that
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   What though on hamely fare we dine
   <br/>
   Wear hoddin gray an' a' that?
   <br/>
   Gie fools their silks and knaves their wine
   <br/>
   A man's a man for a' that
   <br/>
   For a' that, an' a' that
   <br/>
   Their tinsel show an' a' that
   <br/>
   The honest man though e'er sae poor
   <br/>
   Is king o' men for a' that
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Ye see yon birkie ca'd a lord
   <br/>
   Wha struts an' stares an' a' that?
   <br/>
   Though hundreds worship at his word
   <br/>
   He's but a cuif for a' that
   <br/>
   For a' that, an' a' that
   <br/>
   His ribband, star, an' a' that
   <br/>
   The man o' independent mind
   <br/>
   He looks an' laughs at a' that
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   A prince can mak a belted knight
   <br/>
   A marquis, duke, an' a' that
   <br/>
   But an honest man's aboon his might
   <br/>
   Guid faith, he mauna fa' that
   <br/>
   For a' that, an' a' that
   <br/>
   Their dignities an' a' that
   <br/>
   The pith o' sense an' pride o' worth
   <br/>
   Are higher rank than a' that
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Then let us pray that come it may
   <br/>
   As come it will for a' that
   <br/>
   That sense and worth o'er a' the earth
   <br/>
   Shall bear the gree an' a' that
   <br/>
   For a' that, an' a' that
   <br/>
   It's comin' yet for a' that
   <br/>
   That man to man the world o'er
   <br/>
   Shall brithers be for a' that
  </p>
