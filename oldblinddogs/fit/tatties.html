   Oh ye Scots, working men, ye've gone crazy, I fear
   <br/>
   Every day ye maun hae yer but beef and yer beer
   <br/>
   Little ken ye I noo, though ye'll soon come tae learn
   <br/>
   That yer natural food is but tatties and herrin'
   <br/>
   Tatties and herrin', tatties and herrin'
   <br/>
   Yer natural food is but tatties and herrin'
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Wi' a pound in the week ye maun fair be content
   <br/>
   Ye've aye got ten shillings for claes and for rent
   <br/>
   Twa and six tae pit by gin ye need to be sparin'
   <br/>
   Aye, and seven and sixpence for tatties and herrin'
   <br/>
   Tatties and herrin', tatties and herrin'
   <br/>
   Aye, seven and sixpence for tatties and herrin'
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When the harbor o' refuge was first thought about
   <br/>
   Aberdeen and Stanehive, they were fair pitten oot
   <br/>
   Fan they heard that the convicts were gettin' best farin'
   <br/>
   O' guid Buchan tatties and Peterhead herrin'
   <br/>
   Tatties and herrin', tatties and herrin'
   <br/>
   O' guid Buchan tatties and Peterhead herrin'
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Fan the queen's wantin' men tae gang fecht wi' her foes
   <br/>
   It's nae tae the roast beef devourers she goes
   <br/>
   But awa' tae the north amongst the brave and the darin'
   <br/>
   Tae the lads that were brocht up on tatties and herrin'
   <br/>
   Tatties and herrin', tatties and herrin'
   <br/>
   Tae the lads that were brocht up on tatties and herrin'
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Tatties and herrin', tatties and herrin'
   <br/>
   Tae the lads that were brocht up on tatties and herrin'
  </p>
