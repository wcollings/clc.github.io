  <p align="center">
   As I cam' in by Dunideer and doon by Nether Ha'
   <br/>
   There were fifty thoosand' heilan' men a-marchin' tae Harlaw
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus (after each verse)
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Wi' a diddy aye o' an' a fal an' doe
   <br/>
   And a diddy aye o' aye ay
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   As I gaed on an' farther on and doon an' by Balquhain
   <br/>
   Oh it's there I saw Sir James the Rose and wi' him John the Graeme
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "It's cam' ye fae the Heilan's man, cam' ye a' the wey?
   <br/>
   Saw ye MacDonald and his men as they cam' in fae Skye?"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "It's I was near and near eneuch that I their numbers saw
   <br/>
   There was fifty thoosan' heilan' men a-marchin' tae Harlaw"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Gin that be true," says James the Rose, "We'll no cam' muckle speed
   <br/>
   We'll cry upon wir merry men and turn wir horse's heid"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Oh na, o' na," says John the Graeme, "This thing will nivver be
   <br/>
   The gallant Graemes wis nivver beat, we'll try fit we can dae"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, as I gaed on an' further on an' doon an' by Harlaw
   <br/>
   There fell fu' close on ilka side sic straiks ye nivver saw
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There fell fu' close on ilka side sic straiks ye nivver saw
   <br/>
   An' ilka sword gaed clash for clash at the Battle of Harlaw
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The Heilan' men wi' their lang swords, they laid on us fu' sair
   <br/>
   And they drave back wir merry men three acres breadth and mair
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   An' Forbes tae his brither did say, "Noo brither, can't ye see
   <br/>
   They've beaten us back on ilka side and we'll be forced tae flee"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Oh na, na, my brither bold, this thing will nivver be
   <br/>
   Ye'll tak yer guid sword in yer haun', ye'll gang in wi' me"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, it's back tae back the brithers bold gaed in amangst the thrang
   <br/>
   And they drave back the heilan' men wi' swords baith sharp and lang
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   An' the firstan stroke that Forbes struck, he gart MacDonald reel
   <br/>
   An' the neistan straik that Forbes struck, the brave MacDonald fell
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   An siccan a ptlairchie o' the likes ye nivver saw
   <br/>
   As wis amangst the Heilan' men fan they saw MacDonald fa'
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Some rade, some ran and some did gang, they were o' sma' record
   <br/>
   For Forbes and his merry men, they slew them on the road
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   O' fifty thoosan' Heilan' men, but fifty-three gaed hame
   <br/>
   And oot o' a' the Lawlan' men, fifty marched wi' Graeme
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Gin onybody spier at ye for them that marched awa'
   <br/>
   Ye can tell them plain and very plain they're sleepin' at Harlaw
  </p>
