  <p align="center">
   Johnny arose on a May mornin'
   <br/>
   Gone for water tae wash his hands
   <br/>
   He hae loused tae me his twa gray dogs
   <br/>
   That lie bound in iron bands
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When Johnny's mother, she heard o' this
   <br/>
   Her hands for dule she wrang
   <br/>
   Cryin', "Johnny, for yer venison
   <br/>
   Tae the green woods dinna ye gang"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Aye, but Johnny hae taen his good benbow
   <br/>
   His arrows one by one
   <br/>
   Aye, and he's awa tae green wood gaen
   <br/>
   Tae dae the dun deer doon
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh Johnny, he shot, and the dun deer lapp't
   <br/>
   He wounded her in the side
   <br/>
   Aye, between the water and the wood
   <br/>
   The gray dogs laid their pride
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It's by there cam' a silly auld man
   <br/>
   Wi' an ill that John he might dee
   <br/>
   And he's awa' doon tae Esslemont
   <br/>
   Well, the King's seven foresters tae see
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It's up and spake the first forester
   <br/>
   He was heid ane amang them a'
   <br/>
   "Can this be Johnny O' Braidislee?
   <br/>
   Untae him we will draw"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   An' the first shot that the foresters, they fired
   <br/>
   They wounded John in the knee
   <br/>
   An' the second shot that the foresters, they fired
   <br/>
   Well, his hairt's blood blint his e'e
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But he's leaned his back against an oak
   <br/>
   An' his foot against a stane
   <br/>
   Oh and he hae fired on the seven foresters
   <br/>
   An' he's killed them a' but ane
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Aye, he hae broke fower o' this man's ribs
   <br/>
   His airm and his collar bain
   <br/>
   Oh and he has sent him on a horse
   <br/>
   For tae carry the tidings hame
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Johnny's good benbow, it lies broke
   <br/>
   His twa gray dogs, they lie deid
   <br/>
   And his body, it lies doon in Monymusk
   <br/>
   And his huntin' days are daen
   <br/>
   His huntin' days are daen
  </p>
 </body>
