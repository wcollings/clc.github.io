  </p>
  <p align="center">
   As I went out one May morning down by the riverside
   <br/>
   By shadows there and trees so bare, alas to be me bride
   <br/>
   Alas to be me bride, me boys, and the chambers to behold
   <br/>
   I'll never ever forget my love, a jolly sailor bold
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I built my love a gallant ship, a ship of noble frame
   <br/>
   Wi' a hundred jolly sailor boys to box her about the main
   <br/>
   Aye, to box her about the main, me boys, without any fear or doubt
   <br/>
   Wi' me own true love in that gallant ship, we were sadly tossed about
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh the anchor and the cable went overboard straightway
   <br/>
   And the mainmast and the rigging lie a-buried in the sea
   <br/>
   'Twas Tempest sent bad weather and the raging of the sea
   <br/>
   Well, I never had but one true love, he was drowned at sea
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Said the father to the daughter, "What makes you sore lament?
   <br/>
   Oh there is a lad that's in our town will make your heart content"
   <br/>
   "No, there is no lad that's in our town, no noble or duke," cried she
   <br/>
   "Since the raging seas and stormy winds parted my love and me"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "No hankerchief will find my head, no comb go through my hair
   <br/>
   No fire bright nor candle light will view my beauty fair
   <br/>
   Oh never will I married be until the day I die
   <br/>
   Since the raging seas and stormy winds parted me love and I"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh as I went out one May morning down by the riverside
   <br/>
   By shadows there and trees so bare, alas to be me bride
   <br/>
   Alas to be me bride, me boys, the chambers to behold
   <br/>
   I'll never ever forget my love, a jolly sailor bold
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
