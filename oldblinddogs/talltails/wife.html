   I'm sailin' awa' in the morning, I'm sailing awa' on the tide
   <br/>
   And when I return again, lassie, will ye be m'bride?
   <br/>
   Will ye be m'bride, m'boys, will ye be m'bride?
   <br/>
   And when I return again, lassie, will ye be m'bride?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Laddie, I will wait for you as long as m'life
   <br/>
   Laddie, I will wait for you and I'll be a sailor's wife
   <br/>
   I'll be a sailor's wife, m'boys, I'll be a sailor's wife
   <br/>
   Laddie, I will wait for you and I'll be a sailor's wife
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh the sun, it shone, and the wind, it blew, and the ship sailed out to sea
   <br/>
   When she caught the eye of a soldier lad who was standing on the quay
   <br/>
   Standing on the quay, m'boys, standing on the quay
   <br/>
   She caught the eye of a soldier lad who was standing on the quay
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And the storm, it raged, and the cannons roared, and driving was the rain
   <br/>
   After twelve months at the sea, he was homeward bound again
   <br/>
   Homeward bound again, m'boys, homeward bound again
   <br/>
   After twelve months at the sea, he was homeward bound again
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And there he met her at the docks with a baby in her arms
   <br/>
   Saying, "I'm sorry, my sailor lad, but I fell for a soldier's charms"
   <br/>
   I fell for a soldier's charms, m'boys, I fell for a soldier's charms
   <br/>
   Saying, "I'm sorry, my sailor lad, but I fell for a soldier's charms"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Don't you worry, m'bonnie lass," was the sailor's bold retort
   <br/>
   "Don't you worry, m'bonnie lass, I've a wife in every port"
   <br/>
   A wife in every port, m'boys, a wife in every port
   <br/>
   Don't you worry, m'bonnie lass, I've a wife in every port
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   A wife in every port, m'boys, a wife in every port
   <br/>
   Don't you worry, m'bonnie lass, I've a wife in every port
  </p>
