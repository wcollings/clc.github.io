  <p align="center">
   As I was a-walking by the banks o' the Ugie
   <br/>
   Come, my dear friends, and this story I'll relate
   <br/>
   I spied a dear comrade all dressed in white flannel
   <br/>
   Dressed in white flannel and cruel was his fate
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh the mercury was beating, the limestone was reeking
   <br/>
   His tongue all in flames hung over his chin
   <br/>
   A hole in his bosom, his teeth were a-closing
   <br/>
   Bad luck to the girlie that gied him the glim
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus (after each verse)
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   And had she but told me, oh when she dishonored me
   <br/>
   Had she but told me of it in time
   <br/>
   I might have been cured by those pills of white mercury
   <br/>
   Now I'm a young man cut down in my prime
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   My parents, they warned me and oft times they chided
   <br/>
   With those young flash girls do not sport and play
   <br/>
   I never listened, no, I never heeded
   <br/>
   I just carried on in my own wicked way
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It's down on the corner two flash girls were talking
   <br/>
   One to the other did whisper and say
   <br/>
   "There goes that young man who once was so jolly
   <br/>
   Now for his sins his poor body must pay"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh doctor, dear doctor, before your departure
   <br/>
   Take all these bottles of mercury away
   <br/>
   Send for the minister to say a prayer over me
   <br/>
   So they can lay my poor body in the clay
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Now get you six fellows to carry my coffin
   <br/>
   Six pretty fair maids to bear up my pall
   <br/>
   Give each of them there a bunch of red roses
   <br/>
   When they pass by me, they'll not know the smell
  </p>
