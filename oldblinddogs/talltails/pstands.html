   As I went out one May morning to take a pleasant walk
   <br/>
   Well, I sat m'self down by an old faill wall just to hear two lovers talk
   <br/>
   To hear two lovers talk, my dear, to hear what they might say
   <br/>
   That I might know a little more about love before I went away
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus (after each verse)
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   P stands for Paddy, I suppose, J for my love, John
   <br/>
   W stands for false Willie, oh but Johnny is the fairest man
   <br/>
   Johnny is the fairest man, my dear, aye, Johnny's the fairest man
   <br/>
   I don't care what anybody says, Johnny is the fairest man
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Won't you come and sit beside me, beside me on the green
   <br/>
   It's a long three quarters of a year or more since together we have been
   <br/>
   Together we have been, my dear, together we have been
   <br/>
   It's a long three quarters of a year or more since together we have been
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   No, I'll not sit beside you, not now nor at any other time
   <br/>
   For I hear you have another little girl, and your heart's no longer mine
   <br/>
   Your heart's no longer mine, my dear, your heart's no longer mine
   <br/>
   For I hear you have another little girl, and your heart's no longer mine
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So I'll go climb the tall, tall tree, I'll rob the wild bird's nest
   <br/>
   When I come down, I'll go straight home to the girl that I love best
   <br/>
   To the girl that I love best, my dear, the girl that I love best
   <br/>
   When I come down, I'll go straight home to the girl that I love best
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   As I went out one May morning to take a pleasant walk
   <br/>
   Well, I sat m'self down by an old faill wall just to hear two lovers talk
   <br/>
   Aye, to hear two lovers talk, my dear, to hear what they might say
   <br/>
   So that I might know a little more about love before I went away
