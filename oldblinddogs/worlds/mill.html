  <p align="center">
   At Mill o' Tifty there lived a man
   <br/>
   In the neighborhood o' Fyvie
   <br/>
   And he had a lovely daughter dear
   <br/>
   Wha's name was bonnie Annie
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Lord Fyvie had a trumpeter
   <br/>
   By the name o' Andrew Lammie
   <br/>
   And he had the airt tae win the heart
   <br/>
   O' Mill o' Tifty's Annie
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Lord Fyvie, he cam tae the mill
   <br/>
   Whar lived bonnie Annie
   <br/>
   His trumpeter rade him before
   <br/>
   Even the same Andrew Lammie
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Her mither cried her tae the door
   <br/>
   Sayin', "Come here tae me, my Annie
   <br/>
   Did e'er ye see a bonnier man
   <br/>
   Than the trumpeter o' Fyvie?"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Nothing she said, but sighing so
   <br/>
   Alas for bonnie Annie
   <br/>
   She darena own, her heart was won
   <br/>
   By the servant Andrew Lammie
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   That night as a' gaed tae their beds
   <br/>
   A' sleepit soond but Annie
   <br/>
   Love so repressed, her tender breast
   <br/>
   Thinking on Andrew Lammie
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "The first time my love and I met
   <br/>
   Was in the woods o' Fyvie
   <br/>
   He called me mistress, I said no
   <br/>
   I was Tifty's bonnie Annie"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Her faither cam tae hear o' this
   <br/>
   And a letter wrote to Fyvie
   <br/>
   To say his dochter was bewitched
   <br/>
   By the trumpeter o' Fyvie
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Lord Fyvie, he came tae the mill
   <br/>
   Sayin', "What ails ye, bonnie Annie?"
   <br/>
   "Oh it's a' for love that I'm cast doon
   <br/>
   For the love o' Andrew Lammie"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Oh Tifty, Tifty, gie consent
   <br/>
   And let yer dochter marry"
   <br/>
   "Na, it'll be tae ane o' a higher degree
   <br/>
   Than the servant Andrew Lammie"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "If she'd been born o' as rich a kin
   <br/>
   As she is rich in beauty
   <br/>
   I wad hae ta'en the lass mysel
   <br/>
   And made her my ain lady"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Oh Fyvie's lands are far and wide
   <br/>
   And they are wondrous bonnie
   <br/>
   But I wadna trade my ain dear love
   <br/>
   No for a' your lands o' Fyvie"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   At this her faither did her scorn
   <br/>
   And likewise did her mither
   <br/>
   Her sisters they did her disown
   <br/>
   Oh but wae's me for her brither
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Her brither struck her wondrous o'er
   <br/>
   Wi' cruel blows and mony
   <br/>
   He's broke her back on the temple stane
   <br/>
   A' for likin' Andrew Lammie
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Oh faither, mither, sisters a'
   <br/>
   Why sae cruel tae yer Annie?
   <br/>
   My heart was broken first by love
   <br/>
   Noo my brither's broke my body
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh mither, mither, mak my bed
   <br/>
   And turn my head to Fyvie
   <br/>
   For it's there I'll lie and there I'll die
   <br/>
   For the servant Andrew Lammie"
  </p>
