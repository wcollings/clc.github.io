  <p align="center">
   Murray bowed to Charlie, yokin Atholl tae the plou'
   <br/>
   O' the settin sons of Stewart, kings and princes since the Bruce
   <br/>
   Rode to Perth to muster all who hailed the Rover King
   <br/>
   And wi' weary work and bluster hewed an army frae his kin
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus (after each verse)
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   If only the wisest fool
   <br/>
   Had bade where he first should rule
   <br/>
   If only the wisest fool
   <br/>
   Had bade where he first should rule
   <br/>
   Henry's for England, Charles for Spain
   <br/>
   Seamus is Alba's name
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Johnny held a tinchel as the crystal turned to steel
   <br/>
   And the heroes o' the Heilans filled Braemar wi' a' their zeal
   <br/>
   Johnny hummed and hawed, let the loyal Lowlands spile
   <br/>
   Back to France the Rover sailed afore the army of Argyll
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Clavers slipped the council as they offered Will the crown
   <br/>
   Climbed the law to find an army, turned and pulled the Orange down
   <br/>
   Though the Heilan' targes were enough to cow McKay
   <br/>
   To the death of Bonnie Dundee loyal men had no reply
  </p>
