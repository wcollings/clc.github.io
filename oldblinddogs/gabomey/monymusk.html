  <p align="center">
   As I cam in by Monymusk
   <br/>
   And doon by Alford's dale
   <br/>
   A sad misfortune happened to me
   <br/>
   And I think nae shame to tell
   <br/>
   Fal to too ril, fal to too ril aye do
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   As I gaed in by Monymusk
   <br/>
   The moon was shining clear
   <br/>
   And I held on to Lethendy
   <br/>
   To see my Maggie dear
   <br/>
   Fal to too ril, fal to too ril aye do
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I did gang when I did think
   <br/>
   That a' were sleepin' soun'
   <br/>
   But plague upon yon auld wife
   <br/>
   For she cam' slinkin' doon
   <br/>
   Fal to too ril, fal to too ril aye do
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Sae cannily she slipped the lock
   <br/>
   And set the door agee
   <br/>
   Then crawled upon her hands and knees
   <br/>
   To see what it could be
   <br/>
   Fal to too ril, fal to too ril aye do
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Then to the bells wi' a' her micht
   <br/>
   Sae loud she made them ring
   <br/>
   'Til faith, I thocht aboot my lugs
   <br/>
   The biggin she would bring
   <br/>
   Fal to too ril, fal to too ril aye do
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And when she saw I wouldna slip
   <br/>
   She ran to her guidman
   <br/>
   Says, "There's a lad into the hoose
   <br/>
   And this I winna stand
   <br/>
   Fal to too ril, fal to too ril aye do
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   For it's a most disgraceful thing
   <br/>
   It would provoke a saunt
   <br/>
   To see a' the servant girls wi' lads
   <br/>
   When the gentle anes maun want
   <br/>
   Fal to too ril, fal to too ril aye do
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Providence has acted wrang
   <br/>
   Sic pleasures for to gie
   <br/>
   Tae ony servant lad or lass
   <br/>
   Just working for a fee"
   <br/>
   Fal to too ril, fal to too ril aye do
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The auld man, he cam ben himsel
   <br/>
   And he pushed ben his heid
   <br/>
   Guidfaith, I thocht it was a ghost
   <br/>
   Just risen frae the deid
   <br/>
   Fal to too ril, fal to too ril aye do
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He'd duddy drawers upon his legs
   <br/>
   He'd on a cap o' white
   <br/>
   And he'd a face as lang's my leg
   <br/>
   And in his hand a light
   <br/>
   Fal to too ril, fal to too ril aye do
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He's ta'en me by the shoulders broad
   <br/>
   And pushed me out o' doors
   <br/>
   Thinks I, my auld lad, I'll come back
   <br/>
   When sleepin' gars ye snore
   <br/>
   Fal to too ril, fal to too ril aye do
  </p>
