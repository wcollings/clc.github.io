  <p align="center">
   Ae Whitsun day in Huntly toon, it's there I did agree
   <br/>
   Wi' Bogie side o' Cairnie, a six-months for tae fee
   <br/>
   Tae drive his twa best horses, likewise his cairt and ploo
   <br/>
   And tae dee a thing aboot the fairm that richt weel I can do
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Noo Bogie had a dochter wha's name was Isabelle
   <br/>
   The floo'er o' her nation, there's nane her could excel
   <br/>
   She had rosy cheeks and ruby lips and hair a darkish hue
   <br/>
   She was neat, complete and handsome and comely for tae view
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   One day she went a-ramblin' and chose me for her guide
   <br/>
   Tae tak' a pleasant walk wi' her alang by Cairnieside
   <br/>
   I've slipped my airm aboot her waist and tae the groond did slide
   <br/>
   And it's there I've had ma first braw nicht wi' the Belle o' Bogieside
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The blackbird sang sae sweetly, the mavis sang sae shrill
   <br/>
   And a' the chorus o' their sang was, "There lies Bogie's Belle"
   <br/>
   Amang the weeds o' Cairnie, upon the grass sae green
   <br/>
   Then she and I rose up again for fear we would be seen
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   'Ere twenty weeks had passed and gone, this lassie lost her bloom
   <br/>
   Her rosy cheeks grew pale and wan, and she began tae swoon
   <br/>
   'Ere forty weeks had passed and gone, this maid brought forth a son
   <br/>
   And I was quickly sent for tae see what could be done
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Auld Bogie heard my story and cried, "I am undone
   <br/>
   Since ye beguiled my dochter, my sorrows are begun"
   <br/>
   Ah says, "Auld man, ye're fairly richt," and I hung my heid in shame
   <br/>
   "I'll mairry Belle the morning, Ah'll gie the bairn ma name"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But though I said I'd wad the lass, na, na, that wouldnae dae
   <br/>
   "Ye're nae a fittin' match for Belle, nor she a match for ye"
   <br/>
   And he sent me packin' doon the road wi' nae penny o' ma fee
   <br/>
   Sae a' ye lads o' Huntly toon, a lang fareweel tae ye
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And noo she's mairried wi' a tinklerlad wha's name is Soutar John
   <br/>
   He hawks his pans and ladles aroon' by Fogieloan
   <br/>
   And maybe she's got a better match, auld Bogie canna tell
   <br/>
   But it's me wha's ta'en the maidenheid o' Bogie's bonnie Belle
  </p>
