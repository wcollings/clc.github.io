  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He's followed her up and he followed her down
   <br/>
   And into the room where she lay
   <br/>
   She hadn't the strength for to flee from his arms
   <br/>
   Nor the tongue for to answer him nay
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Rise up, rise up, my pretty Polly
   <br/>
   Rise up and go with me
   <br/>
   And I will take you to North Scotland
   <br/>
   And there you'll married be
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Go fetch you a bag of your father's gold
   <br/>
   And some of your mother's fee
   <br/>
   And two fine horses out of the stable
   <br/>
   Where there stands thirty and three"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So she's lit upon her nimble-going brown
   <br/>
   He's mounted the dapple-gray
   <br/>
   And when they came to North Scotland
   <br/>
   'Twas just three hours 'til day
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Light you down, light you down, my pretty Polly
   <br/>
   Light you down, I say to thee
   <br/>
   For six kings' daughters have I drowned here
   <br/>
   And the seventh will surely be thee
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And pull off, pull off your fine gay clothes
   <br/>
   And hang them on yonder tree
   <br/>
   For they are too fine and they cost too much
   <br/>
   To rot in the salt lake sea"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Well, then you take a sickle and you cut down the nettles
   <br/>
   That grow so close to the brim
   <br/>
   For I fear they'll tangle my long yellow hair
   <br/>
   And they'll tear my lily-white skin"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So then he took a sickle and he cut down the nettles
   <br/>
   That grow so close to the brim
   <br/>
   And she's picked him up so skillfully
   <br/>
   And she's pushed  the false knight in
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Lie there, lie there, my false young man
   <br/>
   Lie there in the room of me
   <br/>
   For six kings' daughters have you drowned here
   <br/>
   And the seventh has drowned thee"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So she's lit upon her nimble-going brown
   <br/>
   And she's lead the dapple-gray
   <br/>
   And when she came to her father's door
   <br/>
   'Twas just three hours 'til day
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Hush up, hush up, my pretty Polly bird
   <br/>
   And don't you tell tales on me
   <br/>
   Your cage will be made of the very beaten gold
   <br/>
   And the door of the best ivory"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But then up spoke a fine young man
   <br/>
   In the chamber where he lay
   <br/>
   "What's the matter, what's the matter with my pretty Polly bird?
   <br/>
   You're talking so long before day"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Oh There's two black cats at my caging door
   <br/>
   And my life they will betray
   <br/>
   And I'm just calling for my pretty Polly
   <br/>
   To drive those cats away"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He followed her up and he followed her down
   <br/>
   And into the room where she lay
   <br/>
   She hadn't the strength for to flee from his arms
   <br/>
   Nor the tongue for to answer him nay
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
