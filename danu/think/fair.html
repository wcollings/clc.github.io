  <p align="center">
   Come all you fair and tender ladies
   <br/>
   Take warning how you court young men
   <br/>
   For they're like a star on a cloudy morning
   <br/>
   First they'll appear and then they're gone
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   They'll tell to you some loving stories
   <br/>
   And they'll swear to you that their love is true
   <br/>
   Straight away they'll go and they'll court some other
   <br/>
   And that's the love they have for you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Don't you remember our days of courting?
   <br/>
   You told me then that you loved me best
   <br/>
   You could make me believe with the falling of your arm
   <br/>
   That the sun rose in the west
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   If I had known before I courted
   <br/>
   I never would have courted none
   <br/>
   I'd have locked my heart in a box of golden
   <br/>
   Fastened down with a silver pin
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So come all you fair and tender ladies
   <br/>
   Take warning how you court young men
   <br/>
   They're like a star on a cloudy morning
   <br/>
   First they'll appear and then they're gone
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
