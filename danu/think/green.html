  <p align="center">
   There was a man and he lived in the east
   <br/>
   His trade, it was cutting down brooms, green brooms
   <br/>
   He had a son and his name was John
   <br/>
   And he stayed in bed until noon, 'til noon
   <br/>
   He stayed in bed until noon
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So the father arose and up to John goes
   <br/>
   He swore he would burn his room, gay room
   <br/>
   If he didn't rise and sharpen his knives
   <br/>
   And go down to the wood to cut brooms, green brooms
   <br/>
   And go down to the wood to cut brooms
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So Johnny went on down through the green wood
   <br/>
   'Til he came to a castle of fame, fame, fame
   <br/>
   He spied a fair maid and he stood at the gate
   <br/>
   Crying, "Fair maid, do you want any brooms, green brooms?
   <br/>
   Fair maid, do you want any brooms?"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   This lady, being up in her window so high
   <br/>
   She spied this young man so terribly neat
   <br/>
   She said to her maid, "Go down to the gate
   <br/>
   And call in this young man with his brooms, green brooms
   <br/>
   Call in this young man with his brooms"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So Johnny went into this castle so great
   <br/>
   And entered this lady's room, gay room
   <br/>
   She gave him a chair and she bid him sit down
   <br/>
   Crying, "You're welcome, young man, with your brooms, green brooms
   <br/>
   You're welcome, young man, with your brooms"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   They sent for the priest and married they were
   <br/>
   All in this lady's room, gay room
   <br/>
   So boys, will we drink? Or what do you think?
   <br/>
   There is nothing like cutting down brooms, green brooms
   <br/>
   There's nothing like cutting down brooms, green brooms
   <br/>
   There's nothing like cutting down brooms
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
