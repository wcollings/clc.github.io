  <p align="center">
   As I roved out walking one evening last May
   <br/>
   A charming young damsel I met on my way
   <br/>
   She had jewellery and riches, she had diamonds and gold
   <br/>
   And she said she was a virgin, only nineteen years old
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I quickly fell in love with this beautiful dame
   <br/>
   I asked where she came from, and she told me that same
   <br/>
   In three weeks we were married, and the church bells, they tolled
   <br/>
   I was married to a virgin, only nineteen years old
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   On awakening next morning, I thought I would faint
   <br/>
   When she scraped from her two cheeks a full pound of paint
   <br/>
   And on her left shoulder a hump I behold
   <br/>
   "Oh," sayd I, "You're a daisy, only nineteen years old?"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She pulled out her fingers 'til she left only three
   <br/>
   She screwed off her right leg right over the knee
   <br/>
   She pulled off her false wig, her bald head I behold
   <br/>
   Oh good God Almighty, only nineteen years old
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She pulled out her eyebrow which was black and sublime
   <br/>
   She pulled out her false teeth which was only nine
   <br/>
   She pulled out her glass eye, on the carpet it rolled
   <br/>
   Oh bad luck and damnation to your nineteen years old
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Now all you young fellas, when for marriage you go
   <br/>
   Examine your true love from the top to the toe
   <br/>
   And if you don't do that, like me you'll be sold
   <br/>
   To a damsel not nineteen, but a ninety year old
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
 </body>
