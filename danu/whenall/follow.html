  <p align="center">
   Shutters on the windows, chains upon the door
   <br/>
   Sleepless nights spent waiting for an answer
   <br/>
   Dreams of heaven falling, panic in the town
   <br/>
   Lonely men with fingers on the future
   <br/>
   When all is said and done, you are the only one
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Follow on
   <br/>
   For the open road is waiting
   <br/>
   Like the song
   <br/>
   We will welcome what tomorrow has to bring
   <br/>
   Be it fair or stormy weather
   <br/>
   Take my hand
   <br/>
   And we'll the road together
   <br/>
   I won't mind
   <br/>
   If it turns out that we never find the end
   <br/>
   For all I ask is that you want me for a friend
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Days of beauty calling, vanish through a haze
   <br/>
   Lost inside some spiral with no ending
   <br/>
   Still you bring me loving, heal me with a touch
   <br/>
   Lead me out to greet the calm descending
   <br/>
   When all is said and done, you are the only one
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When all is said and done, you are the only one
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
