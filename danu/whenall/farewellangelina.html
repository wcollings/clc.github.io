  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
   <br/>
   Have been stolen by bandits, I must follow the sound
   <br/>
   The triangle tingles and the trumpets play slow
   <br/>
   But farewell, Angelina, the sky is on fire, and I must go
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There's no need for anger, there's no need for blame
   <br/>
   There's nothing to prove, everything's still the same
   <br/>
   Just a table standing empty by the edge of the sea
   <br/>
   Means farewell, Angelina, the sky is trembling, and I must leave
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The Jack and the Queen have forsaken the courtyard
   <br/>
   And fifty-two gypsies now file past the guards
   <br/>
   In the space where the Deuce and the Ace once ran wild
   <br/>
   Farewell, Angelina, the sky is folding, I'll see you in a while
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   See the cross-eyed pirate sit perched in the sun
   <br/>
   Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun
   <br/>
   And the neighbors, they clap and they cheer with each blast
   <br/>
   But farewell, Angelina, the sky's changing color, and I must leave fast
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   King Kong, little elves on the rooftop, they dance
   <br/>
   Valentino-type tangos while the make-up man's hands
   <br/>
   Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone
   <br/>
   But farewell, Angelina, the sky is embarrassed, and I must be gone
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The machine guns are roaring, and the puppets heave rocks
   <br/>
   And fiends nail time-bombs to the hands of the clocks
   <br/>
   Call me any name you like, I will never deny it
   <br/>
   But farewell, Angelina, the sky is empty, I must go where it's quiet
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Call me any name you like, I will never deny it
   <br/>
   But farewell, Angelina, the sky is empty, I must go where it's quiet
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
 </body>
