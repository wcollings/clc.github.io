   </b>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When you're out walking and there's no one near you
   <br/>
   But a voice keeps calling and you hear your name
   <br/>
   It's not the leaves or the whispering breezes
   <br/>
   It's me that's calling you back again
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus (after each verse)
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Oh can you hear me? Oh can you hear me
   <br/>
   As you roam through lonely London town?
   <br/>
   When evening's falling you'll hear me calling
   <br/>
   Come on home now to the County Down
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Do you remember the fiddlers playing?
   <br/>
   The songs and stories, the whole night long?
   <br/>
   'Tis little then that you thought of leaving
   <br/>
   It seems so strange now that you are gone
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The fish are dancing on Clanrye River
   <br/>
   The teams are sporting in old Glenvale
   <br/>
   My heart no longer can lead the cheering
   <br/>
   When you're not playing, it's a different game
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I'm always thinking that things are changing
   <br/>
   And that they're building a factory tall
   <br/>
   And young ones needed again in Newry
   <br/>
   But I still need you the most of all
  </p>
