     Lyrics

  </p>
  <p align="center">
   'Twas in the County Kerry, a little ways from Clare
   <br/>
   Where the boys and girls are merry at the pattern dance so fair
   <br/>
   The town is called Killorglin, a pretty place to view
   <br/>
   But the thing that makes it interesting is my Bridget Donaghue
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Oh Bridget Donaghue, I really do love you
   <br/>
   Although I'm in America, to you I will be true
   <br/>
   And Bridget Donaghue, I'll tell you what we'll do
   <br/>
   Just take the name of Patterson and I'll take Donaghue
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Her father is a farmer, a decent man is he
   <br/>
   And he's loved and well-respected from Killorglin to Tralee
   <br/>
   And Bridget on a Sunday when coming home from mass
   <br/>
   She's admired by all the people, sure they wait to see her pass
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I sent my love a picture, I did upon my word
   <br/>
   Not a picture of myself, but 'twas a picture of a bird
   <br/>
   It was the Yankee Eagle, says I, "Miss Donaghue
   <br/>
   This eagle's wings are large enough to shelter me and you"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus 2x)
  </p>
