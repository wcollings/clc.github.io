  <p align="center">
   Once I roved out on a fine summer's day
   <br/>
   The fields were in blossom, and the meadows were gay
   <br/>
   I spied a wee lassie tripping over the green
   <br/>
   I took her for Helen, that Grecian queen
   <br/>
   That Grecian queen, that Grecian queen
   <br/>
   I took her for Helen, that Grecian queen
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She's admired by others, I know them right well
   <br/>
   Every morning to view that sweet spot where she dwells
   <br/>
   Beneath the hawthorn at the brink on yon hill
   <br/>
   May she never marry, but think on me still
   <br/>
   Oh think on me still, oh think on me still
   <br/>
   May she never marry, but think on me still
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   My parents died on me, 'tis all for their sake
   <br/>
   And oft times it causes my poor heart to break
   <br/>
   But the more I think on them, the more I will say
   <br/>
   There's no one will be mine but the wee lass on the brae
   <br/>
   Wee lass on the brae, wee lass on the brae
   <br/>
   There's no one will be mine but the wee lass on the brae
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh and faith, there's a decline over yon far-off sky
   <br/>
   'Tis off to my darling like lightning I'll fly
   <br/>
   If the night were as long as a long summer's day
   <br/>
   I'd cheerfully sit with my wee lass on the brae
   <br/>
   Wee lass on the brae, wee lass on the brae
   <br/>
   I'd cheerfully sit with my wee lass on the brae
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So fare thee well, darling, I love you the best
   <br/>
   And may you be happy and may you be blessed
   <br/>
   And may you think on me when I'm far away
   <br/>
   For there's no one will be mine but the wee lass on the brae
   <br/>
   Wee lass on the brae, wee lass on the brae
   <br/>
   There's no one will be mine but the wee lass on the brae
  </p>
