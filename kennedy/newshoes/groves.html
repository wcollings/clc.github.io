  <p align="center">
   My love he is a nice young man, he's handsome, tall and thin
   <br/>
   He's manly in proportion, there's none to equal him
   <br/>
   With his gunbelt and his bayonet and his broadsword by his side
   <br/>
   Oh if I could find my Micheál Bán, I'd surely be his bride
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "What regiment is your true love in?" the sentry he did say
   <br/>
   "Or is he in some barracks? Come tell to me I pray"
   <br/>
   "He listed in the eighty-eight, he being a fine young man
   <br/>
   He commands one hundred and forty-four in the front line where he stands"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   My name it is young Micheál Bán, I'm not afraid to tell
   <br/>
   I come from the county of Tyrone, a place you all know well
   <br/>
   I'm sailing from Philadelphia three thousand miles or more
   <br/>
   And I'm going home, no more to roam from the Groves of Donaghmore
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   This couple they got married and they're living at their ease
   <br/>
   They go out when they're ready and they come in when they please
   <br/>
   Such a happy couple you have never seen before
   <br/>
   As young Micheál Bán and his Mary-Ann from the Groves of Donaghmore
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   My love he is a nice young man, he's handsome, tall and thin
   <br/>
   He's manly in proportion, there's none to equal him
   <br/>
   With his gunbelt and his bayonet and his broadsword by his side
   <br/>
   Oh if I could find my Micheál Bán, I'd surely be his bride
  </p>
