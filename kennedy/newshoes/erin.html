     Lyrics

  </p>
  <p align="center">
   A soldier stood on the village street and bid his love adieu
   <br/>
   His gun and knapsack on his back, his company to renew
   <br/>
   With tears he kissed her once again and turned away his head
   <br/>
   He could but whisper in his pain, and this is what he said
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Love dear, love be true, be only, only mine
   <br/>
   When the war is o'er we'll part no more at Erin on the Rhine"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   As they marched along through the village streets, their banners floating gay
   <br/>
   The children cheered their tramplin' feet that went to the war away
   <br/>
   But one among them turned around once more to look again
   <br/>
   And though his lips gave out no sound, his heart sighed this refrain
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Love dear, love be true, be only, only mine
   <br/>
   When the war is o'er we'll part no more at Erin on the Rhine
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   On the battlefield, the pale cold moon was shedding her peaceful light
   <br/>
   And shining on a soldier boy, on his last discerning flight
   <br/>
   Amid the dying the soldier lay, his comrades close at hand
   <br/>
   He said, "When I am far away, and you in your native land
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Say to my love be true, be only, only mine
   <br/>
   My life is o'er, we'll meet no more at Erin on the Rhine
   <br/>
   Oh say to my love be true, be only, only mine
   <br/>
   My life is o'er, we'll meet no more at Erin on the Rhine"
  </p>
