  <p align="center">
   You and I
   <br/>
   Tempted by the promise of a different life
   <br/>
   Time has fled
   <br/>
   There's a constant battle running through my head
   <br/>
   I don't know what to do
   <br/>
   'Cause I still believe
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   After all the foolish things you put me through
   <br/>
   I can always make a start on something new
   <br/>
   And I'll always be someone who's open to
   <br/>
   Persuasion
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Blind romance
   <br/>
   There'll be no half measures given half a chance
   <br/>
   But we never learn
   <br/>
   Trusting in the fire while the cruel flames burn
   <br/>
   We need to rebuild
   <br/>
   What was never there
   <br/>
   What got left behind
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   After all the foolish things that we've been through
   <br/>
   I could always make a start on something new
   <br/>
   And I'll always be someone who's open to
   <br/>
   Persuasion
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And it's written in my heart
   <br/>
   So that everyone can see it
   <br/>
   And it's written in my soul
   <br/>
   After all, I still believe it
   <br/>
   I still believe it
   <br/>
   I still believe it
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I don't know what to do
   <br/>
   'Cause I still believe
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   After all the foolish things that we've been through
   <br/>
   I can always make a start on something new
   <br/>
   And I'll always be someone who's open to
   <br/>
   Persuasion
   <br/>
   Persuasion
