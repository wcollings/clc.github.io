  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, the first of me rambles I now will sing
   <br/>
   Like any small bird or thrush on the wing
   <br/>
   When the sun arose for to bless the land
   <br/>
   Well, I was free and easy for to jog along
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, the first place I rambled was to Derry Quay
   <br/>
   Just a few miles distant of Ballybofey
   <br/>
   They sat me down for to sing a song
   <br/>
   For I was free and easy for to jog along
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, the next place I rambled was to Glasgow green
   <br/>
   Where lads and lassies were to be seen
   <br/>
   But I was the blithest of all the throng
   <br/>
   For I was free and easy for to jog along
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, I had not gone but a very short space
   <br/>
   When a nice, wee girl, she smiled in my face
   <br/>
   She asked of me, am I a married man
   <br/>
   No, I'm free and easy for to jog along
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, I took this wee girl into an inn
   <br/>
   There we drank brandy, strong ale and gin
   <br/>
   She asked of me, would I give heart and hand
   <br/>
   And give o'er free and easy for to jog along
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh no, fair maiden, such things can't be
   <br/>
   For I am bound for to cross the sea
   <br/>
   When a man gets married, his race is run
   <br/>
   He's no more free and easy for to jog along
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Look at yonder stream, how it gently glides
   <br/>
   It can go no further than it's allowed
   <br/>
   It can go no further that it gets command
   <br/>
   But me, I'm free and easy for to jog along
  </p>
