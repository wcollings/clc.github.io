  <p align="center">
   I am a driver on a western highway
   <br/>
   From the mountains to the sea
   <br/>
   And there's a song on the western highway
   <br/>
   That's saying I will be free
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The sky is fading to the color of the valley
   <br/>
   Dust of angels and dust of dreams
   <br/>
   And your city lights will shine until tomorrow
   <br/>
   And I will not be here
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But your light is brighter than
   <br/>
   Anything I've ever seen
   <br/>
   And I hear your voice on every station
   <br/>
   Singing out of your dreams
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Here I am, on the road again
   <br/>
   The song began and then in the end
   <br/>
   I was standing by, I was standing by the sea
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And by the roadside the trees are shimmering
   <br/>
   Black and silver in the cold night air
   <br/>
   And under the moon a new song is singing
   <br/>
   Saying I will meet you there
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And your light is brighter than
   <br/>
   Anything I've ever seen
   <br/>
   And I hear your voice on every station
   <br/>
   Singing out of your dream
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Here I am, on the road again
   <br/>
   The song began but then in the end
   <br/>
   I was standing by, I was standing by the sea
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And your light is brighter than
   <br/>
   Anything I've ever seen
   <br/>
   And I hear your voice on every station
   <br/>
   Singing out of your dreams
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Here I am, on the road again
   <br/>
   The song began and then in the end
   <br/>
   I was standing by, I was standing by the sea
  </p>

  </cleaned>
