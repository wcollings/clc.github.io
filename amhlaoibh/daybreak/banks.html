  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh hark, the drums do beat, my love, no longer can we stay
   <br/>
   The bugle horns are sounding clear, and we must march away
   <br/>
   We're ordered down to Portsmouth, and it's many's the weary mile
   <br/>
   To join the British Army on the banks of the Nile
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh Johnny, dearest Johnny, don't leave me here to mourn
   <br/>
   Don't make me curse and rue the day that ever I was born
   <br/>
   For the parting of our love would be like parting with my life
   <br/>
   I'll go with you, dear Johnny, and I will be your wife
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh my Nancy, dearest Nancy, that's a thing that can't be so
   <br/>
   The colonel, he has ordered no woman there should go
   <br/>
   We must forsake our own sweethearts, likewise our native soil
   <br/>
   To fight the German soldiers on the banks of the Nile
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But I'll cut off my yellow hair and go along with you
   <br/>
   I'll dress myself in uniform and I'll see Egypt, too
   <br/>
   I'll march beneath your banner while fortune, it do smile
   <br/>
   And we'll comfort one another on the banks of the Nile
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But your waist, it is too slender, love, your fingers, they are too small
   <br/>
   And the sultry suns of Egypt your rosy cheeks would spoil
   <br/>
   Where the cannons, they do rattle, and the bullets, they do fly
   <br/>
   And the silver trumpets sound so loud to hide the dismal cries
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh cursed be those cruel wars that ever they began
   <br/>
   For they have robbed old Ireland of many's the gallant man
   <br/>
   They took from us our own sweethearts while their bodies, they feed the lions
   <br/>
   On the dry and sandy deserts which are the banks of the Nile
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
 </body>
