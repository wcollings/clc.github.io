  <p align="center">
   Oh all the money that e'er I had, I spent it in good company
   <br/>
   And all the harm that e'er I've done, alas, it was to none but me
   <br/>
   And all I've done for want of wit to memory now I can't recall
   <br/>
   So fill to me the parting glass, good night and joy be with you all
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   If I had money enough to spend and leisure time to sit awhile
   <br/>
   There is a fair maid in this town that sorely has my heart beguiled
   <br/>
   Her rosy cheeks and ruby lips I own she has my heart in thrall
   <br/>
   So fill to me the parting glass, good night and joy be with you all
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh all the comrades that e'er I had, they're sorry for my going away
   <br/>
   And all the sweethearts that e'er I had, they beg me one more day to stay
   <br/>
   But since it falls unto my lot that I should rise and you should not
   <br/>
   I'll gently rise and softly call, "Good night and joy be with you all"
  </p>
