     Lyrics

  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The thundering waves are calling me home, home to you
   <br/>
   The pounding sea is calling me home, home to you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   On a dark new year's night on the west coast of Claire
   <br/>
   I heard your voice singing
   <br/>
   Your eyes danced the song, your hands played the tune
   <br/>
   'Twas a vision before me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We left the music behind as the dance carried on
   <br/>
   As we stole away to the seashore
   <br/>
   And smelt the brine, felt the wind in our hair
   <br/>
   With sadness you paused
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Suddenly I knew that you'd have to go
   <br/>
   Your world was not mine, your eyes told me so
   <br/>
   Yet it was there I felt the crossroads of time
   <br/>
   And I wondered why
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   As we cast our gaze on the tumbling sea
   <br/>
   A vision came o'er me
   <br/>
   Of thundering hooves and beating wings
   <br/>
   In the clouds above
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Turning to go, heard you call out my name
   <br/>
   Like a bird in a cage spreading its wings to fly
   <br/>
   "The old ways are lost," you sang as you flew
   <br/>
   And I wondered why
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The thundering waves are calling me home, home to you
   <br/>
   The pounding sea is calling me home, home to you
   <br/>
   The thundering waves are calling me home, home to you
   <br/>
   The pounding sea is calling me home, home to you
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
 </body>
