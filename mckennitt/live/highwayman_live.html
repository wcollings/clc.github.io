  <p align="center">
   The wind was a torrent of darkness among the gusty trees
   <br/>
   The moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas
   <br/>
   The road was a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor
   <br/>
   A highwayman came riding, riding, riding
   <br/>
   A highwayman came riding up to the old inn door
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He'd a French cocked hat on his forehead, a bunch of lace at his chin
   <br/>
   A coat of claret velvet and breeches of brown doe-skin
   <br/>
   They fitted with never a wrinkle, his boots were up to the thigh
   <br/>
   And he rode with a jeweled twinkle, his pistol butts a-twinkle
   <br/>
   His rapier hilt a-twinkle under the jeweled sky
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And over the cobbles he clattered and clashed in the dark inn yard
   <br/>
   And he tapped with his whip on the shutters, but all was locked and barred
   <br/>
   He whistled a tune to the window and who should be waiting there
   <br/>
   But the landlord's black-eyed daughter, Bess, the landlord's daughter
   <br/>
   Plaiting a long red love-knot into her long black hair
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "One kiss, my bonny sweetheart, I'm after a prize tonight
   <br/>
   But I shall be back with the yellow gold before the morning light
   <br/>
   Yet if they press me sharply and harry me through the day
   <br/>
   Then look for me by the moonlight, watch for me by the moonlight
   <br/>
   I'll come to thee by the moonlight though hell should bar the way"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He rose upright in the stirrups, he scarce could reach her hand
   <br/>
   She loosened her hair in the casement, her face burnt like a brand
   <br/>
   As a black cascade of perfume came tumbling over his breast
   <br/>
   And he kissed its waves in the moonlight, oh sweet waves in the moonlight
   <br/>
   He tugged at his rein in the moonlight and galloped away to the west
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He did not come at the dawning, he did not come at noon
   <br/>
   And out of the tawny sunset, before the rise of the moon
   <br/>
   When the road was a gypsy's ribbon looping the purple moor
   <br/>
   A redcoat troop came marching, marching, marching
   <br/>
   King George's men came marching up to the old inn door
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   They said no word to the landlord, they drank his ale instead
   <br/>
   They gagged his daughter and bound her to the foot of her narrow bed
   <br/>
   Two of them knelt at a casement with muskets at their side
   <br/>
   There was death at every window, hell at one dark window
   <br/>
   For Bess could see through the casement the road that he would ride
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   They had tied her up to attention with many a sniggering jest
   <br/>
   And they bound a musket beside her with the barrel beneath her breast
   <br/>
   "Now keep good watch," and they kissed her, she heard the dead man say
   <br/>
   "Look for me by the moonlight, watch for me by the moonlight
   <br/>
   I'll come to thee by the moonlight though hell should bar the way"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She twisted her hands behind her, but all the knots held good
   <br/>
   She writhed her hands 'til her fingers were wet with sweat or blood
   <br/>
   They stretched and strained in the darkness, and the hours crawled by like years
   <br/>
   'Til now on the stroke of midnight, cold on the stroke of midnight
   <br/>
   The tip of one finger touched it, the trigger at least was hers
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Tlot-tlot, had they heard it? The horses' hooves rang clear
   <br/>
   Tlot-tlot, in the distance, were they deaf they did not hear?
   <br/>
   Down the ribbon of moonlight, over the brow of the hill
   <br/>
   The highwayman came riding, riding, riding
   <br/>
   The red-coats looked to their priming, she stood up straight and still
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Tlot, in the frosty silence, tlot, in the echoing night
   <br/>
   Nearer he came and nearer, her face was like a light
   <br/>
   Her eyes grew wide for a moment, she drew one last deep breath
   <br/>
   Her finger moved in the moonlight, her musket shattered the moonlight
   <br/>
   Shattered her breast in the moonlight and warned him with her death
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He turned, he spurred to the west, he did not know she stood
   <br/>
   Bowed with her head o'er the musket drenched with her own red blood
   <br/>
   Not 'til the dawn had he heard it, his face grew grey to hear
   <br/>
   How Bess, the landlord's daughter, the landlord's red-lipped daughter
   <br/>
   Had watched for her love in the moonlight and died in the darkness there
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And back he spurred like a madman shrieking a curse to the sky
   <br/>
   With the white road smoking behind him and his rapier brandished high
   <br/>
   Blood red were the spurs in the golden noon, wine-red was his velvet coat
   <br/>
   When they shot him down on the highway, down like a dog on the highway
   <br/>
   And he lay in his blood on the highway with a bunch of lace at his throat
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Still on a winter's night, they say, when the wind is in the trees
   <br/>
   When the moon is a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas
   <br/>
   When the road is a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor
   <br/>
   A highwayman comes riding, riding, riding
   <br/>
   A highwayman comes riding up to the old inn door
  </p>
