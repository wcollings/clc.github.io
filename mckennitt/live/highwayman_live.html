<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
The wind was a torrent of darkness among the gusty trees<br>
The moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas<br>
The road was a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor<br>
A highwayman came riding, riding, riding<br>
A highwayman came riding up to the old inn door</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
He'd a French cocked hat on his forehead, a bunch of lace at his chin<br>
A coat of claret velvet and breeches of brown doe-skin<br>
They fitted with never a wrinkle, his boots were up to the thigh<br>
And he rode with a jeweled twinkle, his pistol butts a-twinkle<br>
His rapier hilt a-twinkle under the jeweled sky</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
And over the cobbles he clattered and clashed in the dark inn yard<br>
And he tapped with his whip on the shutters, but all was locked and barred<br>
He whistled a tune to the window and who should be waiting there<br>
But the landlord's black-eyed daughter, Bess, the landlord's daughter<br>
Plaiting a long red love-knot into her long black hair</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
"One kiss, my bonny sweetheart, I'm after a prize tonight<br>
But I shall be back with the yellow gold before the morning light<br>
Yet if they press me sharply and harry me through the day<br>
Then look for me by the moonlight, watch for me by the moonlight<br>
I'll come to thee by the moonlight though hell should bar the way"</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
He rose upright in the stirrups, he scarce could reach her hand<br>
She loosened her hair in the casement, her face burnt like a brand<br>
As a black cascade of perfume came tumbling over his breast<br>
And he kissed its waves in the moonlight, oh sweet waves in the moonlight<br>
He tugged at his rein in the moonlight and galloped away to the west</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
He did not come at the dawning, he did not come at noon<br>
And out of the tawny sunset, before the rise of the moon<br>
When the road was a gypsy's ribbon looping the purple moor<br>
A redcoat troop came marching, marching, marching<br>
King George's men came marching up to the old inn door</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
They said no word to the landlord, they drank his ale instead<br>
They gagged his daughter and bound her to the foot of her narrow bed<br>
Two of them knelt at a casement with muskets at their side<br>
There was death at every window, hell at one dark window<br>
For Bess could see through the casement the road that he would ride</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
They had tied her up to attention with many a sniggering jest<br>
And they bound a musket beside her with the barrel beneath her breast<br>
"Now keep good watch," and they kissed her, she heard the dead man say<br>
"Look for me by the moonlight, watch for me by the moonlight<br>
I'll come to thee by the moonlight though hell should bar the way"</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
She twisted her hands behind her, but all the knots held good<br>
She writhed her hands 'til her fingers were wet with sweat or blood<br>
They stretched and strained in the darkness, and the hours crawled by like years<br>
'Til now on the stroke of midnight, cold on the stroke of midnight<br>
The tip of one finger touched it, the trigger at least was hers</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
Tlot-tlot, had they heard it? The horses' hooves rang clear<br>
Tlot-tlot, in the distance, were they deaf they did not hear?<br>
Down the ribbon of moonlight, over the brow of the hill<br>
The highwayman came riding, riding, riding<br>
The red-coats looked to their priming, she stood up straight and still</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
Tlot, in the frosty silence, tlot, in the echoing night<br>
Nearer he came and nearer, her face was like a light<br>
Her eyes grew wide for a moment, she drew one last deep breath<br>
Her finger moved in the moonlight, her musket shattered the moonlight<br>
Shattered her breast in the moonlight and warned him with her death</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
He turned, he spurred to the west, he did not know she stood<br>
Bowed with her head o'er the musket drenched with her own red blood<br>
Not 'til the dawn had he heard it, his face grew grey to hear<br>
How Bess, the landlord's daughter, the landlord's red-lipped daughter<br>
Had watched for her love in the moonlight and died in the darkness there</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
And back he spurred like a madman shrieking a curse to the sky<br>
With the white road smoking behind him and his rapier brandished high<br>
Blood red were the spurs in the golden noon, wine-red was his velvet coat<br>
When they shot him down on the highway, down like a dog on the highway<br>
And he lay in his blood on the highway with a bunch of lace at his throat</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
Still on a winter's night, they say, when the wind is in the trees<br>
When the moon is a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas<br>
When the road is a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor<br>
A highwayman comes riding, riding, riding<br>
A highwayman comes riding up to the old inn door</font></p></body>
