<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua"><b><u>Lyrics</u>:</b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
On either side of the river lie<br>
Long fields of barley and of rye<br>
That clothe the world and meet the sky<br>
And through the field the road run by<br>
To many-towered Camelot<br>
And up and down the people go<br>
Gazing where the lilies blow<br>
'Round an island there below<br>
The island of Shalott</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
Willows whiten, aspens quiver<br>
Little breezes dusk and shiver<br>
Through the wave that runs forever<br>
By the island in the river<br>
Flowing down to Camelot<br>
Four grey walls and four grey towers<br>
Overlook a space of flowers<br>
And the silent isle embowers<br>
The Lady of Shalott</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
Only reapers, reaping early<br>
In amongst the bearded barley<br>
Hear a song that echoes cheerly<br>
From the river winding clearly<br>
Flowing down to Camelot<br>
And by the moon, the reapers weary<br>
Piling sheaves in uplands airy<br>
Listening, whispers, "'Tis the fairy<br>
The Lady of Shalott"</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
There she weaves both night and day<br>
A magic web with colors gay<br>
She has heard a whisper say<br>
A curse is on her if she stay<br>
To look down to Camelot<br>
She knows not what the curse may be<br>
And so she weaveth steadily<br>
Little other care hath she<br>
The Lady of Shalott</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
But in her web she still delights<br>
To weave the mirror's magic sights<br>
For often through the silent nights<br>
A funeral with plumes and lights<br>
And music went to Camelot<br>
Or when the moon was overhead<br>
Came two young lovers lately wed<br>
"I'm half sick of shadows," she said<br>
The Lady of Shalott</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
A bow shot from her bower-eaves<br>
He rode between the barley sheaves<br>
The sun came dazzling through the leaves<br>
And flamed upon the brazen greaves<br>
Of bold Sir Lancelot<br>
A red-cross knight for ever kneeled<br>
To a lady in his shield<br>
That sparkled on the yellow field<br>
Beside remote Shalott</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
His broad clear brow in sunlight glowed<br>
On burnished hooves his war-horse trode<br>
From underneath his helmet flowed<br>
His coal-black curls as on he rode<br>
As he rode down to Camelot<br>
And from the bank and from the river<br>
He flashed into the crystal mirror<br>
"Tirra Lirra," by the river<br>
Sang Sir Lancelot</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
She left the web, she left the loom<br>
She made three paces through the room<br>
She saw the water-lily bloom<br>
She saw the helmet and the plume<br>
She looked to Camelot<br>
Out flew the web and floated wide<br>
The mirror cracked from side to side<br>
"The curse is come upon me," cried<br>
The Lady of Shalott</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
In the stormy east wind straining<br>
The pale yellow woods were waning<br>
The broad stream in his banks complaining<br>
Heavily the low sky raining<br>
Over towered Camelot<br>
Down she came and found a boat<br>
Beneath a willow left afloat<br>
And 'round about the prow she wrote<br>
The Lady of Shalott</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
And in the river's dim expanse<br>
Like some bold seer in a trance<br>
Seeing all his own mischance<br>
With a glassy countenance<br>
She looked to Camelot<br>
And at the closing of the day<br>
She loosed the chain and down she lay<br>
The broad stream bore her far away<br>
The Lady of Shalott</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
Who is this? And what is here?<br>
In the lighted palace near<br>
Died the sound of royal cheer<br>
And they crossed themselves for fear<br>
The knight at Camelot<br>
Lancelot mused a little space<br>
He said, "She has a lovely face<br>
God in His mercy lend her grace<br>
The Lady of Shalott"</font></p></body>
