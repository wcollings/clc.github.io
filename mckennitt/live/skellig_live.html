  <p align="center">
   Oh light the candle, John, the daylight has almost gone
   <br/>
   The birds have sung their last, the bells call all to mass
   <br/>
   Sit here by my side for the night is very long
   <br/>
   There's something I must tell before I pass along
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I joined the brotherhood, its books were all to me
   <br/>
   I scribed the words of God and much of history
   <br/>
   'Twas not my place to leave this life of solitude
   <br/>
   Until one day there came a boat of the brotherhood
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I'd hear the ocean breathe, exhale upon the shore
   <br/>
   I knew the tempest's blood, its wrath I would endure
   <br/>
   And so the years went by within my rocky cell
   <br/>
   With only a mouse or bird, my friend, I loved them well
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And so it came to pass I'd come here to Romani
   <br/>
   And many a year it took 'til I arrived here with thee
   <br/>
   On dusty roads I walked and over mountains high
   <br/>
   Through rivers running deep beneath the endless sky
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Now beneath these jasmine flowers, amidst these cypress trees
   <br/>
   I give you now my books and all their mysteries
   <br/>
   Hearken, John, my word, let not these keys be lost
   <br/>
   The secrets lie within the writings of the past
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh light the candle, John, the daylight is almost gone
   <br/>
   The birds have sung their last, the bells call all to mass
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
 </body>
