  <p align="center">
   Oh Bonny Portmore, I am sorry to see
   <br/>
   Such a woeful destruction of your ornament tree
   <br/>
   For it stood on your shore for many's the long day
   <br/>
   'Til the long boats from Antrim came to float it away
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh Bonny Portmore, you shine where you stand
   <br/>
   And the more I think on you, the more I think long
   <br/>
   If I had you now as I had once before
   <br/>
   All the lords in old England would not purchase Portmore
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   All the birds in the forest, they bitterly weep
   <br/>
   Saying, "Where shall we shelter? Where shall we sleep?"
   <br/>
   For the oak and the ash, they are all cutten down
   <br/>
   And the walls of Bonny Portmore are all down to the ground
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh Bonny Portmore, you shine where you stand
   <br/>
   And the more I think on you, the more I think long
   <br/>
   If I had you now as I had once before
   <br/>
   All the lords of old England would not purchase Portmore
  </p>
