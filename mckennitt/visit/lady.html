  </p>
  <p align="center">
   On either side of the river lie
   <br/>
   Long fields of barley and of rye
   <br/>
   That clothe the world and meet the sky
   <br/>
   And through the field the road run by
   <br/>
   To many-towered Camelot
   <br/>
   And up and down the people go
   <br/>
   Gazing where the lilies blow
   <br/>
   'Round an island there below
   <br/>
   The island of Shalott
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Willows whiten, aspens quiver
   <br/>
   Little breezes dusk and shiver
   <br/>
   Through the wave that runs forever
   <br/>
   By the island in the river
   <br/>
   Flowing down to Camelot
   <br/>
   Four gray walls and four grey towers
   <br/>
   Overlook a space of flowers
   <br/>
   And the silent isle embowers
   <br/>
   The Lady of Shalott
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Only reapers, reaping early
   <br/>
   In among the bearded barley
   <br/>
   Hear a song that echoes cheerly
   <br/>
   From the river winding clearly
   <br/>
   Down to towered Camelot
   <br/>
   And by the moon, the reaper weary
   <br/>
   Piling sheaves in uplands airy
   <br/>
   Listening, whispers, "'Tis the fairy
   <br/>
   The Lady of Shalott"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There she weaves by night and day
   <br/>
   A magic web with colors gay
   <br/>
   She has heard a whisper say
   <br/>
   A curse is on her if she stay
   <br/>
   To look down to Camelot
   <br/>
   She knows not what the curse may be
   <br/>
   And so she weaveth steadily
   <br/>
   Little other care hath she
   <br/>
   The Lady of Shalott
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And moving through a mirror clear
   <br/>
   There hangs before her all the year
   <br/>
   Shadows of the world appear
   <br/>
   There she sees the highway near
   <br/>
   Winding down to Camelot
   <br/>
   And sometimes through the mirror blue
   <br/>
   The knights come riding two and two
   <br/>
   She hath no loyal knight and true
   <br/>
   The Lady of Shalott
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But in her web she still delights
   <br/>
   To weave the mirror's magic sights
   <br/>
   For often through the silent nights
   <br/>
   A funeral with plumes and lights
   <br/>
   And music went to Camelot
   <br/>
   Or when the moon was overhead
   <br/>
   Came two young lovers lately wed
   <br/>
   "I'm half sick of shadows," she said
   <br/>
   The Lady of Shalott
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   A bow shot from her bower-eaves
   <br/>
   He rode between the barley sheaves
   <br/>
   The sun came dazzling through the leaves
   <br/>
   And flamed upon the brazen greaves
   <br/>
   Of bold Sir Lancelot
   <br/>
   A red-cross knight for ever kneeled
   <br/>
   To a lady in his shield
   <br/>
   That sparkled on the yellow field
   <br/>
   Beside remote Shalott
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   His broad clear brow in sunlight glowed
   <br/>
   On burnished hooves his war-horse trode
   <br/>
   From underneath his helmet flowed
   <br/>
   His coal-black curls as on he rode
   <br/>
   As he rode back to Camelot
   <br/>
   And from the bank and from the river
   <br/>
   He flashed into the crystal mirror
   <br/>
   "Tirra Lirra," by the river
   <br/>
   Sang Sir Lancelot
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She left the web, she left the loom
   <br/>
   She made three paces through the room
   <br/>
   She saw the water lily bloom
   <br/>
   She saw the helmet and the plume
   <br/>
   She looked down to Camelot
   <br/>
   Out flew the web and floated wide
   <br/>
   The mirror cracked from side to side
   <br/>
   "The curse is come upon me," cried
   <br/>
   The Lady of Shalott
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   In the stormy east wind straining
   <br/>
   The pale yellow woods were waning
   <br/>
   The broad stream in his banks complaining
   <br/>
   Heavily the low sky raining
   <br/>
   Over towered Camelot
   <br/>
   Down she came and found a boat
   <br/>
   Beneath a willow left afloat
   <br/>
   And 'round about the prow she wrote
   <br/>
   The Lady of Shalott
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And down the river's dim expanse
   <br/>
   Like some bold seer in a trance
   <br/>
   Seeing all his own mischance
   <br/>
   With a glassy countenance
   <br/>
   She looked to Camelot
   <br/>
   And at the closing of the day
   <br/>
   She loosed the chain and down she lay
   <br/>
   The broad stream bore her far away
   <br/>
   The Lady of Shalott
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Heard a carol, mournful, holy
   <br/>
   Chanted loudly, chanted lowly
   <br/>
   'Til her blood was frozen slowly
   <br/>
   And her eyes were darkened wholly
   <br/>
   Turned to towered Camelot
   <br/>
   For 'ere she reached upon the tide
   <br/>
   The first house by the waterside
   <br/>
   Singing in her song she died
   <br/>
   The Lady of Shalott
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Under tower and balcony
   <br/>
   By garden-wall and gallery
   <br/>
   A gleaming shape she floated by
   <br/>
   Dead pale between the houses high
   <br/>
   Silent into Camelot
   <br/>
   And out upon the wharfs they came
   <br/>
   Knight and burgher, lord and dame
   <br/>
   And 'round the prow they read her name
   <br/>
   The Lady of Shalott
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Who is this? And what is here?
   <br/>
   And in the lighted palace near
   <br/>
   Died the sound of royal cheer
   <br/>
   And they crossed themselves for fear
   <br/>
   The knights at Camelot
   <br/>
   Lancelot mused a little space
   <br/>
   He said, "She has a lovely face
   <br/>
   God in His mercy lend her grace
   <br/>
   The Lady of Shalott"
