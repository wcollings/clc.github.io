  <p align="center">
   Wassail, wassail all over the town
   <br/>
   Our toast, it is white, and our ale, it is brown
   <br/>
   Our bowl, it is made of the white maple tree
   <br/>
   With the wassailing bowl we'll drink to thee
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So here is to Cherry and to his right cheek
   <br/>
   Pray God send our master a good piece of beef
   <br/>
   And a good piece of beef that we all may see
   <br/>
   With the wassailing bowl we'll drink to thee
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And here is to Dobbin and to his right eye
   <br/>
   Pray God send our master a good Christmas pie
   <br/>
   And a good Christmas pie that we may all see
   <br/>
   With our wassailing bowl we'll drink to thee
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So here is to Broad May and to her broad horn
   <br/>
   May God send our master a good crop of corn
   <br/>
   And a good crop of corn that we may all see
   <br/>
   With the wassailing bowl we'll drink to thee
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And here is to Fillpail and to her left ear
   <br/>
   Pray God send our master a happy new year
   <br/>
   And a happy new year as e'er he did see
   <br/>
   With our wassailing bowl we'll drink to thee
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And here is to Colly and to her long tail
   <br/>
   Pray God send our master he never may fail
   <br/>
   A bowl of strong beer, I pray you draw near
   <br/>
   And our jolly wassail it's then you shall hear
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Then here's to the maid in the lily-white smock
   <br/>
   Who tripped to the door and slipped back the lock
   <br/>
   Who tripped to the door and pulled back the pin
   <br/>
   For to let these jolly wassailers in
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Wassail, wassail all over the town
   <br/>
   Our toast, it is white, and our ale, it is brown
   <br/>
   Our bowl, it is made of the white maple tree
   <br/>
   With the wassailing bowl we'll drink to thee
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Drink to thee, drink to thee
   <br/>
   With the wassailing bowl we'll drink to thee
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
