   The first good joy that Mary had
   <br/>
   It was the joy of one
   <br/>
   The first rejoice that Mary had
   <br/>
   Was to see her newborn son
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   To see her newborn son, good man
   <br/>
   And blessed may he be
   <br/>
   Sing Father, Son and Holy Ghost
   <br/>
   To all eternity
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The next good joy that Mary had
   <br/>
   It was the joy of two
   <br/>
   To see her son Jesus
   <br/>
   Make the lame to go
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The next rejoice that Mary had
   <br/>
   It was the joy of three
   <br/>
   To see her own son Jesus
   <br/>
   To make the blind to see
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   To make the blind to see, good man
   <br/>
   And blessed may he be
   <br/>
   Sing Father, Son and Holy Ghost
   <br/>
   To all eternity
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The next good joy our lady had
   <br/>
   It was the joy of four
   <br/>
   It was the rejoice of her dear son
   <br/>
   When he read the Bible o'er
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The next good joy that Mary had
   <br/>
   It was the joy of five
   <br/>
   To see her own son Jesus
   <br/>
   To make the dead alive
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   To make the dead alive, good man
   <br/>
   And blessed may he be
   <br/>
   Sing Father, Son and Holy Ghost
   <br/>
   To all eternity
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The next rejoice our lady had
   <br/>
   It was the rejoice of six
   <br/>
   To see her own son Jesus
   <br/>
   To bear the crucifix
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The next good joy that Mary had
   <br/>
   It was the joy of seven
   <br/>
   To see her own son Jesus
   <br/>
   To wear the crown of heaven
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   To wear the crown of heaven, good men
   <br/>
   And blessed may he be
   <br/>
   Sing Father, Son and Holy Ghost
   <br/>
   To all eternity
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And glory may he be
   <br/>
   And blessed now be she
   <br/>
   And those who sing the seven long verses
   <br/>
   In honor of our lady
