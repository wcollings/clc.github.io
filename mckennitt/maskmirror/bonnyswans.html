  <p align="center">
   A farmer there lived in the north country
   <br/>
   A hey ho bonny o
   <br/>
   And he had daughters one, two, three
   <br/>
   The swans swim so bonny o
   <br/>
   These daughters, they walked by the river's brim
   <br/>
   A hey ho bonny o
   <br/>
   The eldest pushed the youngest in
   <br/>
   The swans swim so bonny o
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh sister, oh sister, pray lend me your hand
   <br/>
   With a hey ho a bonny o
   <br/>
   And I will give you house and land
   <br/>
   The swans swim so bonny o
   <br/>
   I'll give you neither hand nor glove
   <br/>
   With a hey ho a bonny o
   <br/>
   Unless you give me your own true love
   <br/>
   The swans swim so bonny o
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Sometimes she sank, sometimes she swam
   <br/>
   With a hey ho and a bonny o
   <br/>
   Until she came to a miller's dam
   <br/>
   The swans swim so bonny o
   <br/>
   The miller's daughter, dressed in red
   <br/>
   With a hey ho and a bonny o
   <br/>
   She went for some water to make her bread
   <br/>
   The swans swim so bonny o
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh father, oh daddy, here swims a swan
   <br/>
   With a hey ho and a bonny o
   <br/>
   It's very like a gentle woman
   <br/>
   The swans swim so bonny o
   <br/>
   They laid her on the bank to dry
   <br/>
   With a hey ho and a bonny o
   <br/>
   There came a harper passing by
   <br/>
   The swans swim so bonny o
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He made harp pins of her fingers fair
   <br/>
   With a hey ho and a bonny o
   <br/>
   He made harp strings of her golden hair
   <br/>
   The swans swim so bonny o
   <br/>
   He made a harp of her breast bone
   <br/>
   With a hey ho and a bonny o
   <br/>
   And straight it began to play alone
   <br/>
   The swans swim so bonny o
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He brought it to her father's hall
   <br/>
   With a hey ho and a bonny o
   <br/>
   And there was the court, assembled all
   <br/>
   The swans swim so bonny o
   <br/>
   He laid the harp upon a stone
   <br/>
   With a hey ho and a bonny o
   <br/>
   And straight it began to play alone
   <br/>
   The swans swim so bonny o
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And there does sit my father the king
   <br/>
   With a hey ho and a bonny o
   <br/>
   And yonder sits my mother the queen
   <br/>
   The swans swim so bonny o
   <br/>
   And there does sit my brother Hugh
   <br/>
   With a hey ho and a bonny o
   <br/>
   And by him William, sweet and true
   <br/>
   The swans swim so bonny o
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And there does sit my false sister Anne
   <br/>
   With a hey ho and a bonny o
   <br/>
   Who drowned me for the sake of a man
   <br/>
   The swans swim so bonny o
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
