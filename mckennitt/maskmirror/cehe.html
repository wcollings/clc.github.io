  <p align="center">
   Beloved, gaze in thine own heart
   <br/>
   The holy tree is growing there
   <br/>
   From joy the holy branches start
   <br/>
   And all the trembling flowers they bear
   <br/>
   The changing colors of its fruit
   <br/>
   Have dowered the stars with merry light
   <br/>
   The surety of its hidden root
   <br/>
   Has planted quiet in the night
   <br/>
   The shaking of its leafy head
   <br/>
   Has given the waves their melody
   <br/>
   And made my lips and music wed
   <br/>
   Murmuring a wizard song for thee
   <br/>
   There the Loves a circle go
   <br/>
   The flaming circle of our days
   <br/>
   Gyring, spiring, to and fro
   <br/>
   In those great ignorant leafy ways
   <br/>
   Remembering all that shaken hair
   <br/>
   And how the wingèd sandals dart
   <br/>
   Thine eyes grow full of tender care
   <br/>
   Beloved, gaze in thine own heart
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Gaze no more in the bitter glass
   <br/>
   The demons with their subtle guile
   <br/>
   Lift up before us when they pass
   <br/>
   Or only gaze a little while
   <br/>
   For there a fatal image grows
   <br/>
   That the stormy night receives
   <br/>
   Roots half hidden under snows
   <br/>
   Broken boughs and blackened leaves
   <br/>
   For all things turn to bareness
   <br/>
   In the dim glass the demons hold
   <br/>
   The glass of outer weariness
   <br/>
   Made when God slept in times of old
   <br/>
   There through the broken branches go
   <br/>
   The ravens of unresting thought
   <br/>
   Flying, crying, to and fro
   <br/>
   Cruel claw and hungry throat
   <br/>
   Or else they stand and sniff the wind
   <br/>
   And shake their ragged wings: alas!
   <br/>
   Thy tender eyes grow all unkind
   <br/>
   Gaze no more in the bitter glass
   <br/>
   Beloved, gaze in thine own heart
   <br/>
   The holy tree is growing there
   <br/>
   From joy the holy branches start
   <br/>
   And all the trembling branches bear
   <br/>
   Remembering all that shaken hair
   <br/>
   And how the wingèd sandals dart
   <br/>
   Thine eyes grow full of tender care
   <br/>
   Beloved, gaze in thine own heart
  </p>
