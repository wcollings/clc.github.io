  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Stars were falling deep in the darkness
   <br/>
   As prayers rose softly, petals at dawn
   <br/>
   And as I listened, your voice seemed so clear
   <br/>
   So calmly you were calling your god
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Somewhere the sun rose o'er dunes in the desert
   <br/>
   Such was the stillness I ne'er felt before
   <br/>
   Was this the question pulling, pulling, pulling you?
   <br/>
   In your heart, in your soul, did you find peace there?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Elsewhere a snowfall, the first in the winter
   <br/>
   Covered the ground as the bells filled the air
   <br/>
   You in your robes sang, calling, calling, calling him
   <br/>
   In your heart, in your soul, did you find peace there?
   <br/>
   In your heart, in your soul, did you find peace there?
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
