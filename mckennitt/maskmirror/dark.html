  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Upon a darkened night
   <br/>
   The flame of love was burning in my breast
   <br/>
   And by a lantern bright
   <br/>
   I fled my house while all in quiet rest
   <br/>
   Shrouded by the night
   <br/>
   And by the secret stair I quickly fled
   <br/>
   The veil concealed my eyes
   <br/>
   While all within lay quiet as the dead
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Oh night, thou was my guide
   <br/>
   Oh night more loving than the rising sun
   <br/>
   Oh night that joined the lover to the beloved one
   <br/>
   Transforming each of them into the other
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Upon that misty night
   <br/>
   In secrecy beyond such mortal sight
   <br/>
   Without a guide or light
   <br/>
   Than that which burned so deeply in my heart
   <br/>
   That fire 'twas led me on
   <br/>
   And shone more bright than of the midday sun
   <br/>
   To where he waited still
   <br/>
   It was a place where no one else could come
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Within my pounding heart
   <br/>
   Which kept itself entirely for him
   <br/>
   He fell into his sleep
   <br/>
   Beneath the cedars all my love I gave
   <br/>
   And by the fortress walls
   <br/>
   The wind would his hair against his brow
   <br/>
   And with its smoothest hand
   <br/>
   Caressed my every sense it would allow
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I lost myself to him
   <br/>
   And laid my face upon my lover's breast
   <br/>
   And care and grief grew dim
   <br/>
   As in the morning's mist became the light
   <br/>
   There they dimmed amongst the lilies fair
   <br/>
   There they dimmed amongst the lilies fair
   <br/>
   There they dimmed amongst the lilies fair
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
