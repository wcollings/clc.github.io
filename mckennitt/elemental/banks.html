     Lyrics

  </p>
  <p align="center">
   As I walked out one morning all in the month of May
   <br/>
   Down by a flowery garden I carelessly did stray
   <br/>
   I overheard a young maid in sorrow did complain
   <br/>
   All for her absent lover who plows the raging main
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I boldly stepped up to her and put her in surprise
   <br/>
   I know she did not know me, I being in disguise
   <br/>
   I says, "Me charming creature, my joy, my heart's delight
   <br/>
   How far have you to travel this dark and dreary night?"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "I'm in search of a faithless young man, Johnny is his name
   <br/>
   And along the Banks of Claudy, I'm told he does remain"
   <br/>
   "This is the Banks of Claudy, fair maid, where on you stand
   <br/>
   But don't depend on Johnny for he's a false young man
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh don't depend on Johnny, for he'll not meet you here
   <br/>
   But tarry with me in yon green wood, no danger need you fear
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh it's six long weeks or better since Johnny left the shore
   <br/>
   He's crossing the wild ocean where the foam and the billows roar
   <br/>
   He's crossing the wild ocean for honor and for fame
   <br/>
   But this I've heard, the ship was wrecked all on the coast of Spain"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh it's when she heard this dreadful news, she flew into despair
   <br/>
   By the wringing of her milk white hands and the tearing of her hair
   <br/>
   Saying, "If Johnny, he is drowned, no man on earth I'll take
   <br/>
   But through lonesome groves and valleys I'll wander for his sake"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh it's when he saw her loyalty, no longer could he stand
   <br/>
   He flew into her arms saying, "Betsy, I'm the man"
   <br/>
   Saying, "Betsy, I'm the young man, the cause of all your pain
   <br/>
   But since we've met on Claudy Banks, we'll never part again"
  </p>
