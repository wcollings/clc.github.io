  <p align="center">
   Here's a health to you, bonny Kellswater
   <br/>
   Where you get all the pleasures of life
   <br/>
   Where you get all the fishing and fowling
   <br/>
   And a bonny wee lass for your wife
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh it's down where yon waters run muddy
   <br/>
   I'm afraid they will never run clear
   <br/>
   And it's when I begin for to study
   <br/>
   My mind is on him that's not here
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And it's this one and that one may court him
   <br/>
   But if any one gets him but me
   <br/>
   It's early and late I will curse them
   <br/>
   The parting lovely Willie from me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh a father, he calls on his daughter
   <br/>
   "Two choices I'll give unto thee
   <br/>
   Would you rather see Willie's ship a-sailing
   <br/>
   See him hung like a dog on yonder tree?"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Oh father, dear father, I love him
   <br/>
   I can no longer bide it from thee
   <br/>
   Through an acre of fire I would travel
   <br/>
   Along with the lovely Willie to be"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh hard was the heartbreak I'm finding
   <br/>
   She took from her full heart's delight
   <br/>
   May the chains of old Ireland come find them
   <br/>
   And softly their pillows at night
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh yonder there's a ship on the ocean
   <br/>
   And she does not know which way to steer
   <br/>
   From the east and the west she's a-blowing
   <br/>
   She reminds me of the charms of my dear
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh it's yonder my Willie will be coming
   <br/>
   He said he'd be here in the spring
   <br/>
   And it's down by yon green shades I'll meet him
   <br/>
   And among wild roses we'll sing
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   For a gold ring he placed on my finger
   <br/>
   Saying, "Love, bear this in your mind
   <br/>
   If ever I sail from old Ireland
   <br/>
   You'll mind, I'll not leave you behind"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Farewell to you, bonny Kellswater
   <br/>
   Where you get all the pleasures of life
   <br/>
   Where you get all the fishing and fowling
   <br/>
   And a bonny wee lass for your wife
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
