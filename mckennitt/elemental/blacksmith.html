     Lyrics

   </b>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   A blacksmith courted me nine months and better
   <br/>
   He fairly won my heart, wrote me a letter
   <br/>
   With his hammer in his hand, he looked quite clever
   <br/>
   And if I was with my love, I'd live forever
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But where is my love gone with his cheeks like roses?
   <br/>
   And his good black Billycock on, decked 'round with primroses?
   <br/>
   I hope the scorching sun won't shine and burn his beauty
   <br/>
   And if I was with my love, I'd do my duty
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Strange news is coming to town, strange news is carried
   <br/>
   Strange news flies up and down that my love is married
   <br/>
   I wish them both much joy though they can't hear me
   <br/>
   And may God reward him well for the slighting of me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Don't you remember when you laid beside me?
   <br/>
   And you said you'd marry me and not deny me?"
   <br/>
   "If I said I'd marry you, it was only for to try you
   <br/>
   So bring your witness, love, and I'll not deny you"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "No witness have I none, save God Almighty
   <br/>
   And may He reward you well for the slighting of me"
   <br/>
   Her lips grew pale and wan, it made a poor heart tremble
   <br/>
   To think she loved a one and he proved deceitful
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   A blacksmith courted me nine months and better
   <br/>
   He fairly won my heart, wrote me a letter
   <br/>
   With his hammer in his hand, he looked quite clever
   <br/>
   And if I was with my love, I'd live forever
  </p>
