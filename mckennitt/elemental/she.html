  <p align="center">
   My love said to me, "My mother won't mind
   <br/>
   And me Father won't slight you for your lack of kind"
   <br/>
   Then she stepped away from me and this she did say
   <br/>
   "It will not be long, love, 'til our wedding day"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She stepped
away from me and she moved through the fair
   <br/>
   And fondly I watched her move here and move there
   <br/>
   She went her way homeward with one star awake
   <br/>
   As the swans in the evening move over the lake
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The people were saying, "No two e'er were wed
   <br/>
   But one has a sorrow that never was said"
   <br/>
   And she smiled as she passed me with her goods and her gear
   <br/>
   And that was the last that I saw of my dear
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I dreamed it last night that my true love came in
   <br/>
   So softly she entered, her feet made no din
   <br/>
   She came close beside me and this she did say
   <br/>
   "It will not be long, love, 'til our wedding day"
  </p>
