  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Come by the hills to the land where fancy is free
   <br/>
   And stand where the peaks meet the sky and the rocks reach the sea
   <br/>
   Where the rivers run clear and the bracken is gold in the sun
   <br/>
   And cares of tomorrow must wait 'til this day is done
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Come by the hills to the land where life is a song
   <br/>
   And sing while the birds fill the air with their joy all day long
   <br/>
   Where the trees sway in time and even the wind sings in tune
   <br/>
   And cares of tomorrow must wait 'til this day is done
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Come by the hills to the land where legend remains
   <br/>
   Where stories of old stir the heart and may yet come again
   <br/>
   Where the past has been lost and the future is still to be won
   <br/>
   And cares of tomorrow must wait 'til the day is done
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Come by the hills to the land where fancy is free
   <br/>
   And stand where the peaks meet the sky and the rocks reach the sea
   <br/>
   Where the rivers run clear and the bracken is gold in the sun
   <br/>
   And cares of tomorrow must wait 'til this day is done
   <br/>
   Cares of tomorrow must wait 'til this day is done
  </p>
