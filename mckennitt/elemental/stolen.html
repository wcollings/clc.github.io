     Lyrics

   </b>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Where dips the rocky highland of sleuth wood in the lake
   <br/>
   There lies a leafy island where flapping herons wake
   <br/>
   The drowsy water rats there we've hid our fairy vats
   <br/>
   Full of berries and of reddest stolen cherries
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Come away, oh human child
   <br/>
   To the waters and the wild
   <br/>
   With a faery hand in hand
   <br/>
   For the world's more full of weeping
   <br/>
   Than you can understand
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Where the wave of moonlight glosses the dim grey sands with light
   <br/>
   By far off furthest rosses we foot it all the night
   <br/>
   Weaving olden dances, mingling hands and mingling glances
   <br/>
   'Til the moon has taken flight to and fro we leap
   <br/>
   And chase the frothy bubbles whilst the world is full of troubles
   <br/>
   And is anxious in its sleep
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Where the wandering water gushes from the hills above glen car
   <br/>
   In pools among the rushes that scarce could bathe a star
   <br/>
   We seek for slumbering trout and whispering in their ears
   <br/>
   Give them unquiet dreams leaning softly out
   <br/>
   From ferns that drop their tears over the young streams
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Away with us he's going, the solemned eyed
   <br/>
   He'll hear no more the lowing of the calves on the warm hillside
   <br/>
   Or the kettle on the hob sing peace unto his breast
   <br/>
   Or see the brown mice bob 'round and 'round the oatmeal chest
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   For he comes, the human child
   <br/>
   To the waters and the wild
   <br/>
   With a faery hand in hand
   <br/>
   For the world's more full of weeping
   <br/>
   Than you can understand
  </p>
