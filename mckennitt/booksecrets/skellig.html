  <p align="center">
   Oh light the candle, John, the daylight has almost gone
   <br/>
   The birds have sung their last, the bells call all to mass
   <br/>
   Sit here by my side for the night is very long
   <br/>
   There's something I must tell before I pass along
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I joined the brotherhood, my books were all to me
   <br/>
   I scribed the words of God and much of history
   <br/>
   Many a year was I perched out upon the sea
   <br/>
   The waves would wash my tears, the wind, my memory
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I'd hear the ocean breathe, exhale upon the shore
   <br/>
   I knew the tempest's blood, its wrath I would endure
   <br/>
   And so the years went by within my rocky cell
   <br/>
   With only a mouse or bird, my friend, I loved them well
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And so it came to pass I'd come here to Romani
   <br/>
   And many a year it took 'til I arrived here with thee
   <br/>
   On dusty roads I walked and over mountains high
   <br/>
   Through rivers running deep beneath the endless sky
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Beneath these jasmine flowers, amidst these cypress trees
   <br/>
   I give you now my books and all their mysteries
   <br/>
   Now take the hourglass and turn it on its head
   <br/>
   For when the sands are still, 'tis then you'll find me dead
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh light the candle, John, the daylight is almost gone
   <br/>
   The birds have sung their last, the bells call all to mass
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
 </body>
