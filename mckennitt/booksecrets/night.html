  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Ride on through the night, ride on
   <br/>
   Ride on through the night, ride on
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There are visions, there are memories
   <br/>
   There are echoes of thundering hooves
   <br/>
   There are fires, there is laughter
   <br/>
   There's the sound of a thousand doves
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Ride on through the night, ride on
   <br/>
   Ride on through the night, ride on
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   In the velvet of the darkness
   <br/>
   By the silhouette of silent trees
   <br/>
   They are watching, they are waiting
   <br/>
   They are witnessing life's mysteries
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Ride on through the night, ride on
   <br/>
   Ride on through the night, ride on
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Cascading stars on the slumbering hills
   <br/>
   They are dancing as far as the sea
   <br/>
   Riding over land you can feel its gentle hand
   <br/>
   Leading on to its destiny
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Ride on through the night, ride on
   <br/>
   Ride on through the night, ride on
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Take me with you on this journey
   <br/>
   Where the boundaries of time are now tossed
   <br/>
   In cathedrals of the forest
   <br/>
   In the words of the tongues now lost
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Find the answers, ask the questions
   <br/>
   Find the roots of an ancient tree
   <br/>
   Take me dancing, take me singing
   <br/>
   I'll ride on 'til the moon meets the sea
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Ride on through the night, ride on
   <br/>
   Ride on through the night, ride on
   <br/>
   Ride on through the night, ride on
   <br/>
   Ride on through the night, ride on
  </p>
