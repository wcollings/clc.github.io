  </p>
  <p align="center">
   On Raglan Road on an autumn day
   <br/>
   I saw him first and knew
   <br/>
   That his dark hair would weave a snare
   <br/>
   That I might one day rue
   <br/>
   I saw the danger and yet I walked
   <br/>
   Along the enchanted way
   <br/>
   And I said, "Let grief be a falling leaf
   <br/>
   At the dawning of the day"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   On Grafton Street in November
   <br/>
   We tripped lightly along the ledge
   <br/>
   Of a deep ravine where can be seen
   <br/>
   The worth of passions pledge
   <br/>
   The Queen of Hearts still making tarts
   <br/>
   And I not making hay
   <br/>
   But I loved too much, by such and such
   <br/>
   Is happiness thrown away
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I gave him the gifts of the mind
   <br/>
   I gave him the secret sign
   <br/>
   That's known all to the artists
   <br/>
   Who have known true gods of sound and time
   <br/>
   With word and tint I never did stint
   <br/>
   I gave him reams of poems to say
   <br/>
   With his own name there and his shiny black hair
   <br/>
   Like the clouds over fields of May
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   On a quiet street where old ghosts meet
   <br/>
   I see him walking now
   <br/>
   Away from me so hurriedly
   <br/>
   My reason must allow
   <br/>
   That I had ruled not as I should
   <br/>
   A creature made of clay
   <br/>
   When the angel woos the clay he'll lose
   <br/>
   His wings at the dawn of the day
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
