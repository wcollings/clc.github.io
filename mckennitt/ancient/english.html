   It was an English ladye bright
   <br/>
   The sun shines fair on Carlisle wall
   <br/>
   And she would marry a Scottish knight
   <br/>
   For love will still be lord of all
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Blithely they saw the rising sun
   <br/>
   When he shone fair on Carlisle wall
   <br/>
   But they were sad ere day was done
   <br/>
   Though love was still the lord of all
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Her sire gave brooch and jewel fine
   <br/>
   Where the sun shines fair on Carlisle wall
   <br/>
   Her brother gave but a flask of wine
   <br/>
   For ire that love was lord of all
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   For she had lands, both meadow and lea
   <br/>
   Where the sun shines fair on Carlisle wall
   <br/>
   For he swore her death, ere he would see
   <br/>
   A Scottish knight the lord of all
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   That wine she had not tasted well
   <br/>
   The sun shines fair on Carlisle wall
   <br/>
   When dead in her true love's arms she fell
   <br/>
   For love was still the lord of all
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He pierced her brother to the heart
   <br/>
   Where the sun shines fair on Carlisle wall
   <br/>
   So perish all would true love part
   <br/>
   That love may still be lord of all
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And then he took the cross divine
   <br/>
   Where the sun shines fair on Carlisle wall
   <br/>
   And died for her sake in Palestine
   <br/>
   So love was still the lord of all
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Now all ye lovers that faithful prove
   <br/>
   The sun shines fair on Carlisle wall
   <br/>
   Pray for their souls who died for love
   <br/>
   For love shall still be lord of all
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
