  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The moonlight, it was dancing on the waves out on the sea
   <br/>
   The stars of heaven hovered in a shimmering galaxy
   <br/>
   A voice from down the ages, so in haunting in its song
   <br/>
   These ancient stones will tell us, our love must make us strong
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The breeze, it wrapped around me as I stood there on the shore
   <br/>
   And listened to this voice like I never heard before
   <br/>
   Our battles they may find us, no choice may ours to be
   <br/>
   But hold the banner proudly, and the truth will set us free
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   My mind was called across the years of rages and of strife
   <br/>
   And all the human misery and all the waste of life
   <br/>
   We wondered where our God was in the face of so much pain
   <br/>
   And I looked up to the stars above to find you once again
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We travelled the wide oceans, heard many call your name
   <br/>
   With sword and gun and hatred, it all seemed much the same
   <br/>
   Some used your name for glory, some used it for their gain
   <br/>
   Yet when liberty lay wanting, no lives were lost in vain
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Is it not our place to wonder as the sky does weep with tears?
   <br/>
   And all the living creatures look on with mortal fear
   <br/>
   It is ours to hold the banner, it is ours to hold it long
   <br/>
   It is ours to carry forward, our love must make us strong
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And as the warm wind carried its song into the night
   <br/>
   I closed my eyes and tarried until the morning light
   <br/>
   As the last star, it shimmered and the new sun's day gave birth
   <br/>
   It was in this magic moment came this prayer for mother earth
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The moonlight, it was dancing on the waves out on the sea
   <br/>
   The stars of heaven hovered in a shimmering galaxy
   <br/>
   And a voice from down the ages, so in haunting in its song
   <br/>
   These ancient stones will tell us, our love must make us strong
  </p>
