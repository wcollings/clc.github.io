  </p>
  <p align="center">
   This glancing life is like a morning star
   <br/>
   A setting sun or rolling waves at sea
   <br/>
   A gentle breeze or lightning in a storm
   <br/>
   A dancing dream of all eternity
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The sand was shimmering in the morning light
   <br/>
   And dancing off the dunes so far away
   <br/>
   The night held music so sweet, so long
   <br/>
   And there we lay until the break of day
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We woke that morning at the onward call
   <br/>
   Our camels bridled up, our howdahs full
   <br/>
   The sun was rising in the eastern sky
   <br/>
   Just as we set out to the desert's cry
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Calling, yearning, pulling home to you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The tents grew smaller as we rode away
   <br/>
   On earth that tells of many passing days
   <br/>
   The months of peace and all the years of war
   <br/>
   The lives of love and all the lives of fears
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Calling, yearning, pulling home to you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We crossed the river beds all etched in stone
   <br/>
   And up the mighty mountains ever known
   <br/>
   Beyond the valleys in the searing heat
   <br/>
   Until we reached the caravanserai
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Calling, yearning, pulling home to you
   <br/>
   Calling, yearning, pulling home to you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   What is this life that pulls me far away?
   <br/>
   What is that home where we cannot reside?
   <br/>
   What is that quest that pulls me onward?
   <br/>
   My heart is full when you are by my side
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Calling, yearning, pulling home to you
   <br/>
   Calling, yearning, pulling home to you
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
