   Let all that are to mirth inclined
   <br/>
   Consider well and bear in mind
   <br/>
   What our good God for us has done
   <br/>
   In sending His beloved Son
   <br/>
   For to redeem our souls from thrall
   <br/>
   Christ is the savior of us all
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The twenty-fifth day of December
   <br/>
   We have good cause to remember
   <br/>
   In Bethlehem upon that morn
   <br/>
   There was a blessed Messiah born
   <br/>
   But mark how all things came to pass
   <br/>
   The inn and lodgings filled was
   <br/>
   That they could find no room at all
   <br/>
   But in a straw-filled ox's stall
   <br/>
   For to redeem our souls from thrall
   <br/>
   Christ is the savior of us all
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Near Bethlehem some shepherds keep
   <br/>
   Their flocks and herds of feeding sheep
   <br/>
   To whom God's angels did appear
   <br/>
   Which put the shepherds in great fear
   <br/>
   With thankful heart and joyful mind
   <br/>
   The shepherds went this babe to find
   <br/>
   And as the heavenly angel told
   <br/>
   They did our savior Christ behold
   <br/>
   For to redeem our souls from thrall
   <br/>
   Christ is the savior of us all
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Three eastern wise men from afar
   <br/>
   Directed by a glorious star
   <br/>
   Came boldly on and made no stay
   <br/>
   Until they came where Jesus lay
   <br/>
   And being come unto that place
   <br/>
   Where the blessed Messiah was
   <br/>
   They humbly laid before His feet
   <br/>
   Their gifts of gold and incense sweet
   <br/>
   For to redeem our souls from thrall
   <br/>
   Christ is the savior of us all
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   See how the Lord of heaven and earth
   <br/>
   Showd Himself lowly in His birth
   <br/>
   A sweet example for mankind
   <br/>
   To learn to bear an humble mind
   <br/>
   For to redeem our souls from thrall
   <br/>
   Christ is the savior of us all
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Let all your songs and praises be
   <br/>
   Unto His heavenly majesty
   <br/>
   And evermore amongst our mirth
   <br/>
   Remember Christ our savior's birth
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Let all that are to mirth inclined
   <br/>
   Consider well and bear in mind
   <br/>
   What our good God for us has done
   <br/>
   In sending His beloved Son
   <br/>
   For to redeem our souls from thrall
   <br/>
   Christ is the savior of us all
