   Come all you lads and lasses, I'd have you give attention
   <br/>
   To these few lines I'm about to write here
   <br/>
   'Tis of the four seasons of the year that I shall mention
   <br/>
   Beauty of all things doth appear
   <br/>
   And now you are young and all in your prosperity
   <br/>
   Come cheer up your hearts and revive like the spring
   <br/>
   Join off in pairs like the birds in February
   <br/>
   That St. Valentine's Day it forth do bring
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Then cometh spring, which all the land doth nourish
   <br/>
   The fields are beginning to be decked with green
   <br/>
   The trees put forth their buds and the blossoms they do flourish
   <br/>
   The tender blades of corn on the earth are to be seen
   <br/>
   Don't you see the little lambs by the dams a-playing?
   <br/>
   The cuckoo is singing in the shady grove
   <br/>
   The flowers they are springing, the maids they go a-Maying
   <br/>
   And in love all hearts seem now to move
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Then cometh autumn with the sun so hot and piercing
   <br/>
   The sportsman goes forth with his dog and his gun
   <br/>
   To fetch down the woodcock, the partridge and the pheasant
   <br/>
   For health and for profit as well as for fun
   <br/>
   Behold, with loaded apple trees the farmer is befriended
   <br/>
   They will full up his casks that have long laid dry
   <br/>
   All nature seems to weary now, her task is nearly ended
   <br/>
   And more of the seasons will come by and by
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When night comes on with song and tale we pass the wintry hours
   <br/>
   By keeping up a cheerful heart we hope for better days
   <br/>
   We tend the cattle, sow the seed, give work unto the plowers
   <br/>
   With patience wait 'til winter yields before the sun's fair rays
   <br/>
   And so the world goes 'round and 'round, and every time and season
   <br/>
   With pleasure and profit crowns the passage of the year
   <br/>
   And so through every time of life, to him who acts with reason
   <br/>
   The beauty of all things doth appear
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
