   Good people all this Christmastime
   <br/>
   Consider well and bear in mind
   <br/>
   What our good God for us has done
   <br/>
   In sending His beloved Son
   <br/>
   With Mary holy we should pray
   <br/>
   To God with love this Christmas day
   <br/>
   In Bethlehem upon that morn
   <br/>
   There was a blessed Messiah born
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The night before that happy tide
   <br/>
   The noble virgin and her guide
   <br/>
   Were long time seeking up and down
   <br/>
   To find a lodging in the town
   <br/>
   But mark how all things came to pass
   <br/>
   From every door repelled, alas
   <br/>
   As long foretold, their refuge all
   <br/>
   Was but an humble ox's stall
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There were three wise men from afar
   <br/>
   Directed by a glorious star
   <br/>
   And on they wandered night and day
   <br/>
   Until they came where Jesus lay
   <br/>
   And when they came unto that place
   <br/>
   Where our beloved Messiah was
   <br/>
   They humbly cast them at His feet
   <br/>
   With gifts of gold and incense sweet
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Near Bethlehem did shepherds keep
   <br/>
   Their flocks of lambs and feeding sheep
   <br/>
   To whom God's angels did appear
   <br/>
   Which put the shepherds in great fear
   <br/>
   "Prepare and go," the angels said
   <br/>
   "To Bethlehem, be not afraid
   <br/>
   For there you'll find this happy morn
   <br/>
   A princely babe, sweet Jesus born"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   With thankful heart and joyful mind
   <br/>
   The shepherds went the babe to find
   <br/>
   And as God's angel had foretold
   <br/>
   They did our savior Christ behold
   <br/>
   Within a manger He was laid
   <br/>
   And by His side the virgin maid
   <br/>
   Attending on the Lord of life
   <br/>
   Who came on earth to end all strife
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
