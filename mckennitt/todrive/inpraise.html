  <p align="center">
   All hail to the days that merit more praise
   <br/>
   Than all of the rest of the year
   <br/>
   And welcome the nights that double delights
   <br/>
   As well for the poor as the peer
   <br/>
   Good fortune attend each merry man's friend
   <br/>
   That doth but the best that he may
   <br/>
   Forgetting old wrongs with carols and songs
   <br/>
   To drive the cold winter away
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   'Tis ill for a mind to anger inclined
   <br/>
   To think of small injuries now
   <br/>
   If wrath be to seek, do not lend her thy cheek
   <br/>
   Nor let her inhabit thy brow
   <br/>
   Cross out of thy books malevolent looks
   <br/>
   Both beauty and youth's decay
   <br/>
   And wholly consort with mirth and with sport
   <br/>
   To drive the cold winter away
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   This time of the year is spent in good cheer
   <br/>
   And neighbors together do meet
   <br/>
   To sit by the fire with friendly desire
   <br/>
   Each other in love to greet
   <br/>
   Old grudges forgot are put in the pot
   <br/>
   All sorrows aside they lay
   <br/>
   The old and the young doth carol this song
   <br/>
   To drive the cold winter away
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When Christmas tide comes in like a bride
   <br/>
   With holly and ivy clad
   <br/>
   Twelve days in the year much mirth and good cheer
   <br/>
   In every household is had
   <br/>
   The country guise is then to devise
   <br/>
   Some gambols of Christmas play
   <br/>
   Whereat the young men do the best that they can
   <br/>
   To drive the cold winter away
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
