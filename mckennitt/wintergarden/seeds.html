  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I sowed the seeds of love
   <br/>
   I sowed them in the spring
   <br/>
   I gathered them up in the morning so clear
   <br/>
   When the small birds so sweetly sing
   <br/>
   When the small birds so sweetly sing
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The gardener was standing by
   <br/>
   I asked him to choose for me
   <br/>
   He chose for me the violet, the lily and the pink
   <br/>
   But those I refused all three
   <br/>
   But those I refused all three
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The violet I did not like
   <br/>
   Because it bloomed so soon
   <br/>
   The lily and the pink I really overthink
   <br/>
   So I thought I would wait 'til June
   <br/>
   So I thought I would wait 'til June
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   In June there was a red rose bud
   <br/>
   That is the flower for me
   <br/>
   I often times have plucked the red rose bud
   <br/>
   'Til I gained the willow tree
   <br/>
   'Til I gained the willow tree
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The willow tree will twist
   <br/>
   The willow tree will twine
   <br/>
   I often times  have wished I was in the young man's arms
   <br/>
   Who once had the heart of mine
   <br/>
   Who once had the heart of mine
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I sowed the seeds of love
   <br/>
   I sowed them in the spring
   <br/>
   I gathered them up in the morning so soon
   <br/>
   When the small birds so sweetly sing
   <br/>
   When the small birds so sweetly sing
  </p>

  </cleaned>
