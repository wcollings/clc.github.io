Joyful mystery, the birth of our Lord... This night our Lady and St. Joseph was going 
up to get registered and, um, they were going down the road and they met this man and 
he said, "Have you any room?" and he said, "No, but there's an old stable over there 
that I owned, if yous want to go into it." And they went over and the Lord came down 
from the heaven at twelve o'clock and loads of beautiful angels was with them, and 
when they were walkin'...</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
I walk the streets of Dublin town<br>
It's eighteen forty-two<br>
It's snowing on this Christmas Eve<br>
Think I'll beg another bob or two<br>
I'll huddle in this doorway here<br>
'Til someone comes along<br>
If the lamp lighter comes real soon<br>
Maybe I'll go home with him<br>
Maybe I can find a place I can call my home<br>
Maybe I can find a home I can call my own</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
These three wise kings, um, they were all from different countries. And they 
always used to look up at the sky and they looked up this night and saw this 
beautiful star up in the sky. And when they were going they all meeted together and 
they had to pass King Herod's, not that we much care for him. And they went in and 
he said, "Where ye goin' with yer best stitches on ye?"</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
The horses on the cobbled stones go by<br>
Think I'll get one, one fine day<br>
And ride into the countryside<br>
And very far away<br>
But now as the daylight disappears<br>
I best find a place to sleep<br>
Think I'll slip into the bell tower<br>
In the church just down the street<br>
Maybe I can find a place I can call my home<br>
Maybe I can find a home I can call my own</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
And they said, "Did you not hear the news?" and say he says, "What news?" He says, 
"This day the Savior is born." And he says to them, "When you find him come back 
and tell me 'cause I want to go and adore him too." And he was only coddin' them. 
He wanted to kill him and when they were going, they stopped and they said, "Surely 
not this old stable that our King is born in. We were expecting a palace."</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
Maybe on the way I'll find the dog<br>
I saw the other night<br>
And tuck him underneath my jacket<br>
So we'll stay warm through the night<br>
And as we lie in the bell tower high<br>
And dream of days to come<br>
The bells o'er head will call the hours<br>
The day we will find a home<br>
Maybe I can find a place I can call my home<br>
Maybe I can find a home I can call my own<br>
Maybe I can find a place I can call my home<br>
Maybe I can find a home I can call my own</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
There was these shepherds and shepherds are fellas that mind the foals and cows 
and sheeps and little lambs and all and, um, they hears this beautiful music up 
in the sky and they were wondering what was so fun. An angel disappated them and 
he said, "I was wonderin' what was so fun" and he said ye, and he said, "The 
savior is born. If yous want to go see him, follow that star up in the sky," and 
it was a beautiful star.</font></p></body>
