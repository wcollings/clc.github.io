     Lyrics

  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Harking is bonny and there lives my love
   <br/>
   My love lies on him and cannot remove
   <br/>
   It cannot remove for all that I have done
   <br/>
   And I never will forget my love Annachie
   <br/>
   For Annachie Gordon, he's bonny and he's bright
   <br/>
   He'd entice any woman that e'er, e'er he saw
   <br/>
   He'd entice any woman and so he has done me
   <br/>
   And I never will forget my love Annachie
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Down came her father, he's standing at the door
   <br/>
   Saying, "Jeannie, you are trying the tricks of a whore
   <br/>
   You care nothing for a man who cares so very much for thee
   <br/>
   You must marry Lord Sultan and leave Annachie
   <br/>
   For Annachie Gordon, he's barely but a man
   <br/>
   Although he may be pretty but where are his lands?
   <br/>
   For the Sultan's lands are broad and his towers, they run high
   <br/>
   You must marry Lord Sultan and leave Annachie"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "With Annachie Gordon I beg for my bread
   <br/>
   Before I marry Sultan, his gold to my head
   <br/>
   With gold to my head and straight down to my knee
   <br/>
   And I'll die if I don't get my love Annachie
   <br/>
   And you who are my parents, to church you may me bring
   <br/>
   But unto Lord Sultan I'll never bear a son
   <br/>
   To a son or a daughter I'll never bow my knee
   <br/>
   And I'll die if I don't get my love Annachie"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Jeannie was married and from church was brought home
   <br/>
   When she and her maidens so merry should have been
   <br/>
   When she and her maidens so merry should have been
   <br/>
   She goes into her chamber and cries all alone
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Come to my bed, my Jeannie, my honey and my sweet
   <br/>
   To stile you my mistress, it would be so sweet"
   <br/>
   "Be it mistress or Jeanne, it's all the same to me
   <br/>
   But in your bed, Lord Sultan, I never will lie"
   <br/>
   And down came her father, he's spoken with reknown
   <br/>
   Saying, "You who are her maidens, go loosen up her gowns"
   <br/>
   And she fell down to the floor and straight down to her knee saying
   <br/>
   "Father, look I'm dying for my love Annachie"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The day that Jeanne married was the day that Jeannie died
   <br/>
   And the day that young Annachie came home on the tide
   <br/>
   And down came her maidens all wringing of their hands
   <br/>
   Saying, "Oh it's been so long, you've been so long on the sands
   <br/>
   So long on the sands, so long upon the floods
   <br/>
   They have married your Jeannie and now she lies dead"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "You who are her maidens, come take me by the hand
   <br/>
   And lead me to the chamber where my love, she lies in"
   <br/>
   And he kissed her cold lips 'til his heart, it turned to stone
   <br/>
   And he died in the chamber that his love, she lies in
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
