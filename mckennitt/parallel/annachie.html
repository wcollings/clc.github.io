    Harking is bonny and there lives my love
    <br/>
    My love lies on him and cannot remove
    <br/>
    It cannot remove for all that I have done
    <br/>
    And I never will forget my love Annachie
    <br/>
    For Annachie Gordon, he's bonny and he's bright
    <br/>
    He'd entice any woman that e'er, e'er he saw
    <br/>
    He'd entice any woman and so he has done me
    <br/>
    And I never will forget my love Annachie
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    Down came her father, he's standing at the door
    <br/>
    Saying, "Jeannie, you are trying the tricks of a whore
    <br/>
    You care nothing for a man who cares so very much for thee
    <br/>
    You must marry Lord Sultan and leave Annachie
    <br/>
    For Annachie Gordon, he's barely but a man
    <br/>
    Although he may be pretty but where are his lands?
    <br/>
    For the Sultan's lands are broad and his towers, they run high
    <br/>
    You must marry Lord Sultan and leave Annachie"

   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    "With Annachie Gordon I beg for my bread
    <br/>
    Before I marry Sultan, his gold to my head
    <br/>
    With gold to my head and straight down to my knee
    <br/>
    And I'll die if I don't get my love Annachie
    <br/>
    And you who are my parents, to church you may me bring
    <br/>
    But unto Lord Sultan I'll never bear a son
    <br/>
    To a son or a daughter I'll never bow my knee
    <br/>
    And I'll die if I don't get my love Annachie"

    Jeannie was married and from church was brought home
    <br/>
    When she and her maidens so merry should have been
    <br/>
    When she and her maidens so merry should have been
    <br/>
    She goes into her chamber and cries all alone

    "Be it mistress or Jeanne, it's all the same to me
    <br/>
    But in your bed, Lord Sultan, I never will lie"
    <br/>
    And down came her father, he's spoken with reknown
    <br/>
    Saying, "You who are her maidens, go loosen up her gowns"
    <br/>
    And she fell down to the floor and straight down to her knee saying

    The day that Jeanne married was the day that Jeannie died
    <br/>
    And the day that young Annachie came home on the tide
    <br/>
    And down came her maidens all wringing of their hands
    <br/>
    Saying, "Oh it's been so long, you've been so long on the sands
    <br/>
    So long on the sands, so long upon the floods
    <br/>
    They have married your Jeannie and now she lies dead"

    "You who are her maidens, come take me by the hand
    <br/>
    And lead me to the chamber where my love, she lies in"
    <br/>
    And he kissed her cold lips 'til his heart, it turned to stone
    <br/>
    And he died in the chamber that his love, she lies in
