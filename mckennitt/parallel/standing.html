   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    In one of these lonely Orkney Isles there dwelled a maiden fair
    <br/>
    Her cheeks were red, her eyes were blue, she had yellow, curling hair
    <br/>
    Which caught the eye and then the heart of one who could never be
    <br/>
    A lover of so true a maid or fair a form as she
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    Across the lake in Sandwick dwelled a youth she held most true
    <br/>
    And ever since her infancy he had watched these eyes so blue
    <br/>
    The land runs out into the sea, it's a narrow neck of land
    <br/>
    Where weird and grim the Standing Stones in a circle where they stand
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    One bonny moonlight Christmas Eve, they met at that sad place
    <br/>
    With her heart in glee and the beams of love were shining on her face
    <br/>
    When her lover came and he grasped her hand and what loving words they said
    <br/>
    They talked of future's happy days as through the stones they strayed
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    They walked toward the lovers' stone and through it passed their hands
    <br/>
    They plighted there a constant troth sealed by love's steadfast bands
    <br/>
    He kissed his maid and then he watched her that lonely bridge go o'er
    <br/>
    For little, little did he think, he wouldn't see his darling more
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    <u>
     Chorus
    </u>
    :
    <br/>
    Standing Stones of the Orkney Isles
    <br/>
    Gazing out to sea
    <br/>
    Standing Stones of the Orkney Isles
    <br/>
    Bring my love to me
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    He turned his face toward his home, that home he did never see
    <br/>
    And you shall have the story as it was told to me
    <br/>
    When a form upon him sprang with a dagger gleaming bright
    <br/>
    It pierced his heart and his dying screams disturbed the silent night
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    This maid had nearly reached her home when she was startled by a cry
    <br/>
    And she turned to look around her and her love was standing by
    <br/>
    His hand was pointing to the stars and his eyes gazed at the light
    <br/>
    And with a smiling countenance he vanished from her sight
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    She quickly turned and home she ran, not a word of this was said
    <br/>
    For well she knew at seeing his form that her faithful love was dead
    <br/>
    And from that day she pined away, not a smile seen on her face
    <br/>
    With outstretched arms she went to meet him in a brighter place
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    (Chorus 2x)
   </font>
  </p>
