     Lyrics
    </u>
    :

  </p>
  <p align="center">
   In one of these lonely Orkney Isles there dwelled a maiden fair
   <br/>
   Her cheeks were red, her eyes were blue, she had yellow, curling hair
   <br/>
   Which caught the eye and then the heart of one who could never be
   <br/>
   A lover of so true a maid or fair a form as she
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Across the lake in Sandwick dwelled a youth she held most true
   <br/>
   And ever since her infancy he had watched these eyes so blue
   <br/>
   The land runs out into the sea, it's a narrow neck of land
   <br/>
   Where weird and grim the Standing Stones in a circle where they stand
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   One bonny moonlight Christmas Eve, they met at that sad place
   <br/>
   With her heart in glee and the beams of love were shining on her face
   <br/>
   When her lover came and he grasped her hand and what loving words they said
   <br/>
   They talked of future's happy days as through the stones they strayed
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   They walked toward the lovers' stone and through it passed their hands
   <br/>
   They plighted there a constant troth sealed by love's steadfast bands
   <br/>
   He kissed his maid and then he watched her that lonely bridge go o'er
   <br/>
   For little, little did he think, he wouldn't see his darling more
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Standing Stones of the Orkney Isles
   <br/>
   Gazing out to sea
   <br/>
   Standing Stones of the Orkney Isles
   <br/>
   Bring my love to me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He turned his face toward his home, that home he did never see
   <br/>
   And you shall have the story as it was told to me
   <br/>
   When a form upon him sprang with a dagger gleaming bright
   <br/>
   It pierced his heart and his dying screams disturbed the silent night
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   This maid had nearly reached her home when she was startled by a cry
   <br/>
   And she turned to look around her and her love was standing by
   <br/>
   His hand was pointing to the stars and his eyes gazed at the light
   <br/>
   And with a smiling countenance he vanished from her sight
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She quickly turned and home she ran, not a word of this was said
   <br/>
   For well she knew at seeing his form that her faithful love was dead
   <br/>
   And from that day she pined away, not a smile seen on her face
   <br/>
   With outstretched arms she went to meet him in a brighter place
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus 2x)
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
