<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
In one of these lonely Orkney Isles there dwelled a maiden fair<br>
Her cheeks were red, her eyes were blue, she had yellow, curling hair<br>
Which caught the eye and then the heart of one who could never be<br>
A lover of so true a maid or fair a form as she</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
Across the lake in Sandwick dwelled a youth she held most true<br>
And ever since her infancy he had watched these eyes so blue<br>
The land runs out into the sea, it's a narrow neck of land<br>
Where weird and grim the Standing Stones in a circle where they stand</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
One bonny moonlight Christmas Eve, they met at that sad place<br>
With her heart in glee and the beams of love were shining on her face<br>
When her lover came and he grasped her hand and what loving words they said<br>
They talked of future's happy days as through the stones they strayed</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
They walked toward the lovers' stone and through it passed their hands<br>
They plighted there a constant troth sealed by love's steadfast bands<br>
He kissed his maid and then he watched her that lonely bridge go o'er<br>
For little, little did he think, he wouldn't see his darling more</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua"><u>Chorus</u>:<br>
Standing Stones of the Orkney Isles<br>
Gazing out to sea<br>
Standing Stones of the Orkney Isles<br>
Bring my love to me</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
He turned his face toward his home, that home he did never see<br>
And you shall have the story as it was told to me<br>
When a form upon him sprang with a dagger gleaming bright<br>
It pierced his heart and his dying screams disturbed the silent night</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
This maid had nearly reached her home when she was startled by a cry<br>
And she turned to look around her and her love was standing by<br>
His hand was pointing to the stars and his eyes gazed at the light<br>
And with a smiling countenance he vanished from her sight</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
She quickly turned and home she ran, not a word of this was said<br>
For well she knew at seeing his form that her faithful love was dead<br>
And from that day she pined away, not a smile seen on her face<br>
With outstretched arms she went to meet him in a brighter place</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">(Chorus 2x)</font></p></body>
