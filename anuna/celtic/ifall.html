   What can I say?
   <br/>
   I'll never know what happened today
   <br/>
   I'd written a song to string her along
   <br/>
   I knew it was wrong
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   She told me we would last forever
   <br/>
   That all she'd ever had was me
   <br/>
   I've just said good-bye
   <br/>
   Based on a lie that I told to my sweet love
   <br/>
   But if all she has is you
   <br/>
   Make sure you're one in a million
   <br/>
   If all she has is you
   <br/>
   Make sure you're one in a million
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She's waited in vain
   <br/>
   A figure in black alone in the rain
   <br/>
   She still wears my ring, a curious thing
   <br/>
   A curious thing
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   If all she has is you
   <br/>
   Make sure you're one in a million
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
