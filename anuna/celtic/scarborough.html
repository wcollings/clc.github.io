   Are you going to Scarborough fair?
   <br/>
   Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
   <br/>
   Remember me to one who lives there
   <br/>
   She once was a true love of mine
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Tell her to make me a cambric shirt
   <br/>
   Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
   <br/>
   Without any seam nor needlework
   <br/>
   Then she'll be a true love of mine
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Ask him to find me an acre of land
   <br/>
   Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
   <br/>
   Between the salt water and the sea-sand
   <br/>
   Then he'll be a true love of mine
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When he has done and finished his work
   <br/>
   Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
   <br/>
   Ask himto come for his cambric shirt
   <br/>
   Then he'll be a true love of mine
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Are you going to Scarborough fair?
   <br/>
   Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
   <br/>
   Remember me to one who lives there
   <br/>
   She once was a true love of mine
   <br/>
   She once was a true love of mine
   <br/>
   She once was a true love of mine
