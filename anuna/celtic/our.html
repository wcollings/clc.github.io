  <p align="center">
   I once had a true love and I loved her so well
   <br/>
   I loved her far better than my tongue can tell
   <br/>
   And I thought that she whispered to me and did say
   <br/>
   "It will not be long, love, 'til our wedding day"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I dreamt last night that my true love came in
   <br/>
   So softly she entered that her feet made no din
   <br/>
   And I dreamt that she whispered to me and did say
   <br/>
   "It will not be long, love, 'til our wedding day
   <br/>
   It will not be long, love, 'til our wedding day"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   If I were an eagle and I had wings to fly
   <br/>
   I would fly to my love's castle and it's there I would lie
   <br/>
   On a bed of green ivy I would lay myself down
   <br/>
   And it's with my two fond wings I would my love surround
   <br/>
   And it's with my two fond wings I would my love surround
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I once had a true love and I loved her so well
   <br/>
   I loved her far better than my tongue can tell
   <br/>
   And I thought that she whispered to me and did say
   <br/>
   "It will not be long, love, 'til our wedding day
   <br/>
   It will not be long, love, 'til our wedding day"
