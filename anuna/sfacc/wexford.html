   Good people all this Christmas time
   <br/>
   Consider well and bear in mind
   <br/>
   What our good God for us has done
   <br/>
   In sending His beloved Son
   <br/>
   With Mary holy we should pray
   <br/>
   To God with love this Christmas day
   <br/>
   In Bethlehem upon that morn
   <br/>
   There was a blessed Messiah born
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Near Bethlehem did shepherds keep
   <br/>
   Their flocks of lambs and feeding sheep
   <br/>
   To whom God's angels did appear
   <br/>
   Which put the shepherds in great fear
   <br/>
   "Prepare and go," the angels said
   <br/>
   "To Bethlehem, be not afraid
   <br/>
   For there you'll find this happy morn
   <br/>
   A princely babe, sweet Jesus born"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   With thankful heart and joyful mind
   <br/>
   The shepherds went the babe to find
   <br/>
   And as God's angels had foretold
   <br/>
   They did our savior Christ behold
   <br/>
   Within a manger He was laid
   <br/>
   And by His side the virgin maid
   <br/>
   Attending on the Lord of Life
   <br/>
   Who came from earth to end all strife
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Good people all this Christmas time
   <br/>
   Consider well and bear in mind
   <br/>
   What our good God for us has done
   <br/>
   In sending His beloved Son
  </p>
