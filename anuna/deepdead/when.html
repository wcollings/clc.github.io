  <p align="center">
   When I was in my prime
   <br/>
   I flourished like a vine
   <br/>
   There came along a false young man
   <br/>
   That stole the heart of mine
   <br/>
   That stole the heart of mine
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The gardener standing by
   <br/>
   Three offers he made to me
   <br/>
   The pink, the violet and red rose
   <br/>
   Which I refused all three
   <br/>
   Which I refused all three
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The pink's no flower at all
   <br/>
   For it fades away too soon
   <br/>
   And the violet is too pale a hue
   <br/>
   I think I'll wait 'til June
   <br/>
   I think I'll wait 'til June
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   In June the red rose blooms
   <br/>
   That's not the flower for me
   <br/>
   For then I'll pluck the red rose off
   <br/>
   And plant a willow tree
   <br/>
   And plant a willow tree
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And the willow tree shall weep
   <br/>
   And the willow tree shall whine
   <br/>
   I wish I was in the young man's arms
   <br/>
   That stole the heart of mine
   <br/>
   That stole the heart of mine
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   If I'm spared for one year more
   <br/>
   And God should grant me grace
   <br/>
   I'll weep a bowl of crystal tears
   <br/>
   To wash his deceitful face
   <br/>
   To wash his deceitful face
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
 </body>
