     Lyrics

  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I once had a sweetheart but now I have none
   <br/>
   He's gone and he's left me in sorrow to weep and mourn
   <br/>
   He's gone and he's left me for others to see
   <br/>
   I know that he'll soon find another far better than me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I wrote him a letter both loving and kind
   <br/>
   He wrote me an answer with sharp twisted lines
   <br/>
   Saying, "Keep your love letters, and I will keep mine
   <br/>
   You write to your love, and I'll write to mine"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Green grows the laurel, soft falls the dew
   <br/>
   Hard was my heart when I parted from you
   <br/>
   In our next meeting I hope you'll prove true
   <br/>
   And we'll join the green laurel for the violet so blue
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He passes my window both early and late
   <br/>
   The looks that he gives me would make my heart break
   <br/>
   The looks that he gives me a thousand would kill
   <br/>
   Whenever he wanders, he'll be my love still
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus 2x)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   For the violet so blue, for the violet so blue
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
