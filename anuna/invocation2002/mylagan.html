  <p align="center">
   Where Lagan stream sings lullaby, there blooms a lily fair
   <br/>
   The twilight gleam is in her eye, the night is on her hair
   <br/>
   And like a lovesick lenanshee, she hath my heart in thrall
   <br/>
   Nor life I own, nor liberty, for love is lord of all
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Her father sails a running-barge 'twixt Leamh-beag and The Druim
   <br/>
   And on the lonely river-marge she clears his hearth for him
   <br/>
   When she was only fairy-high her gentle mother died
   <br/>
   But dew-love keeps her memory green on the Lagan-side
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And oft-times when the beetle's horn hath lulled the eve to sleep
   <br/>
   I steal into her shieling lorn and through the dooring peep
   <br/>
   There on the crickets' singing-stone she spares the bogwood fire
   <br/>
   And hums in sad, sweet undertone the song of heart's desire
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Her welcome, like her love for me, is from her heart within
   <br/>
   Her warm kiss is felicity that knows no taint of sin
   <br/>
   And when I stir my foot to go, 'tis leaving love and light
   <br/>
   To feel the wind of longing blow from out the dark of night
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
