  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Rising early out of bed across the fields I steered O
   <br/>
   When, oh and I, a young woman I spied, a pretty fair maiden appeared O
   <br/>
   Her health was fair, I do declare, she had neither a hat nor feather on
   <br/>
   She stooped so low, gave me to know 'twas mushrooms she was gathering O
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Where are you going?" says I, "My dear, why are you up so early O?
   <br/>
   I've seen you on the dewy grass before the sower early O"
   <br/>
   Quite modestly she answered me and she gave her head one fetch up
   <br/>
   And she said, "I am gathering mushrooms for to make my mammy ketchup O
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Her parting breast on mine she pressed, her heart was like a feather O
   <br/>
   Her lips on mine did gently join, and we both sat down together O
   <br/>
   Rising early out of bed across the fields I steered O
   <br/>
   When, oh and I, a young woman I spied, a pretty fair maiden appeared O
  </p>
