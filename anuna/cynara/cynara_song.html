  <p align="center">
   Last night, ah yesternight, between her lips and mine
   <br/>
   There fell thy shadow, Cynara, thy breath was shed
   <br/>
   Upon my soul between the kisses and the wine
   <br/>
   And I was desolate and sick of an old passion
   <br/>
   Yea, I was desolate and bowed my head
   <br/>
   I have been faithful to thee, Cynara, in my fashion
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   All night upon mine heart I felt her warm heart beat
   <br/>
   Nightlong within mine arms in love and sleep she lay
   <br/>
   Surely the kisses of her bought red mouth were sweet
   <br/>
   And I was desolate and sick of an old passion
   <br/>
   When I awoke and found the dawn was gray
   <br/>
   I have been faithful to thee, Cynara, in my fashion
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I have forgot much, Cynara, gone with the wind
   <br/>
   Flung roses riotously with the throng
   <br/>
   Dancing, dancing to put thy pale, lost lilies out of my mind
   <br/>
   And I was desolate and sick of an old passion
   <br/>
   Yea, all the time because the dance was long
   <br/>
   I have been faithful to thee, Cynara, in my fashion
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I cried for madder music and for stronger wine
   <br/>
   But when the feast is finished and the lamps expire
   <br/>
   There falls thy shadow, Cynara, the night is thine
   <br/>
   And I was desolate and sick of an old passion
   <br/>
   Yea, hungry for the lips of my desire
   <br/>
   I have been faithful to thee, Cynara, in my fashion
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
