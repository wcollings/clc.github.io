  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Down by the salley gardens my love and I did meet
   <br/>
   She passed the salley gardens with little snow-white feet
   <br/>
   She bid me take love easy as the leaves grow on the tree
   <br/>
   But I being young and foolish with her would not agree
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   In a field by the river my love and I did stand
   <br/>
   And on my leaning shoulder she laid her snow-white hand
   <br/>
   She bid me take life easy as the grass grows on the weirs
   <br/>
   But I was young and foolish and now I'm full of tears
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She bid me take life easy as the grass grows on the weirs
   <br/>
   But I was young and foolish and now I'm full of tears
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
