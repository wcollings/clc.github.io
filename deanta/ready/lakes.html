  <p align="center">
   'Twas on one bright March morning I bid New Orleans adieu
   <br/>
   And I took the rode to Jackson town, me fortune to renew
   <br/>
   I cursed all foreign money, no credit could I gain
   <br/>
   Which filled me heart with longing for the lakes of Pontchartrain
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I stepped on board of a railroad car beneath the morning sun
   <br/>
   I rode the road 'til evening and I laid me down again
   <br/>
   All strangers there, no friends to me, 'til a dark girl towards me came
   <br/>
   And I fell in love with a Creole girl by the lakes of Pontchartrain
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I said, "My pretty Creole girl, me money here's no good
   <br/>
   If it weren't for the alligators, I'd sleep out in the wood"
   <br/>
   "You're welcome here, kind stranger, our house, it's very plain
   <br/>
   But we never turn a stranger out from the lakes of Pontchartrain"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She took me to her mammy's house and treated me right well
   <br/>
   The hair upon her shoulders in jet-black ringlets fell
   <br/>
   To try and paint her beauty, I'm sure 'twould be in vain
   <br/>
   So handsome was my Creole girl by the lakes of Pontchartrain
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And I asked her if she'd marry me, she'd said it could never be
   <br/>
   For she had got another, and he was far at sea
   <br/>
   She said that she would wait for him and true she would remain
   <br/>
   'Til he returned for his Creole girl by the lakes of Pontchartrain
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So fare thee well, me bonny own girl, I never will see no more
   <br/>
   But I'll ne'er forget your kindness in the cottage by the shore
   <br/>
   And at each social gathering a flowing glass I'll raise
   <br/>
   And I'll drink a health to me Creole girl and the lakes of Pontchartrain
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
 </body>
