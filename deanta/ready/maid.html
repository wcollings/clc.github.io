   It's cold and raw the north winds blow
   <br/>
   Black in the morning early
   <br/>
   When all the hills were covered with snow
   <br/>
   Oh then it was winter fairly
   <br/>
   As I was riding o'er the moor
   <br/>
   I met a farmer's daughter
   <br/>
   Her cherry cheeks and sloe-black hair
   <br/>
   They caused my heart to falter
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I bowed my bonnet very low
   <br/>
   To let her know my meaning
   <br/>
   She answered with a courteous smile
   <br/>
   Her looks they were engaging
   <br/>
   "Where are you bound, my pretty maid
   <br/>
   It's now in the morning early?"
   <br/>
   The answer that she made to me
   <br/>
   "Kind sir, to sell me barley"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Now twenty guineas I've in my purse
   <br/>
   And twenty more that's yearly
   <br/>
   You need not go to the market town
   <br/>
   For I'll buy all your barley
   <br/>
   If twenty guineas would gain the heart
   <br/>
   Of the maid I love so dearly
   <br/>
   All for to tarry with me one night
   <br/>
   And go home in the morning early"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   As I was riding o'er the moor
   <br/>
   The very evening after
   <br/>
   It was my fortune for to meet
   <br/>
   The farmer's only daughter
   <br/>
   Although the weather being cold and raw
   <br/>
   With her I thought to parley
   <br/>
   The answer then she made to me
   <br/>
   "Kind sir, I've sold me barley"
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
