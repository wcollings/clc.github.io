  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Through Benedy Glen oft at eve have I wandered
   <br/>
   With a heart that is lighter than the dew of the morn
   <br/>
   Her heather-clad mountains and clear crystal fountains
   <br/>
   Delightful to view by the light of the dawn
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I see her green hills and swift-running streamlets
   <br/>
   Eternally flowing right on to the sea
   <br/>
   By her side I lie down on a bank of blue violets
   <br/>
   And its murmuring and gurgling are music to me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   In far foreign lands oft do her sons wander
   <br/>
   By Niagara Falls or the Prairie Grand
   <br/>
   Where nature is seen both majestic and savage
   <br/>
   But their hearts are at home in their dear native land
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   They long to return to the banks of the Lena
   <br/>
   The Roe and its branches on every side
   <br/>
   Where there lies brave Cooey, that once-mighty chieftain
   <br/>
   Who once 'gainst the Saxon defended with pride
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Her daughters are fair and her sons, they are gallant
   <br/>
   They scorn the tyrant, the serf or the slave
   <br/>
   Their rights they maintain at the point of the bayonet
   <br/>
   With an arm that is strong and a heart that is brave
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   In an abbey not far from the town of Dungiven
   <br/>
   Their spirit hovers over that once much-loved soil
   <br/>
   Where there lies brave Cooey, that once-mighty chieftain
   <br/>
   Who commanded of yore from the Bann to the Foyle
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   His statue disfigured by base alien mongrels
   <br/>
   His name oft impaired by unscrupulous foes
   <br/>
   Yet his soul shines in glory 'mid choirs of angels
   <br/>
   As his body lies moldering on the banks of the Roe
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Long may she prosper 'neath her sheltering mountains
   <br/>
   Carntogher, Benbradagh and surrounding hills
   <br/>
   From calamity and famine, great heaven, defend them
   <br/>
   And grant them contentment 'neath their clear purling rills
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
