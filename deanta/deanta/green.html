  <p align="center">
   So pack up your seastores, consider no longer
   <br/>
   For ten dollars a week isn't very bad pay
   <br/>
   With no taxes or tithes to devour up your wages
   <br/>
   When you're on the green fields of Amerikay
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Farewell to the groves of shellelagh and shamrock
   <br/>
   Farewell to the wee girls of Ireland all 'round
   <br/>
   May your hearts be as merry as ever I could wish for
   <br/>
   When it's far away across the ocean I'm bound
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, me father is old, and me mother's quite feeble
   <br/>
   And to leave their own country, it grieves their hearts sore
   <br/>
   And the tears down their cheeks in great drops are rolling
   <br/>
   To think they must die upon a foreign shore
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The sheep run unsheered and the land's run to rushes
   <br/>
   The handyman's gone, and the winder of creals
   <br/>
   Away across the ocean go journeyman tailors
   <br/>
   And fiddlers that flaked out the old mountain reels
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Ah but I mind the day when old Ireland was flourishing
   <br/>
   And when lots of hard tradesmen did work for good pay
   <br/>
   Ah but since our manufacturies have crossed the Atlantic
   <br/>
   Sure it's there we must follow to Amerikay
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And it's now to conclude and to finish my story
   <br/>
   If ever friendless Irishmen chances my way
   <br/>
   With the best in the house I will greet him and welcome
   <br/>
   Far away on the green fields of Amerikay
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
