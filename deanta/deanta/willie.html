     Lyrics

  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Willie Taylor and his youthful lover
   <br/>
   Full of mirth and loyalty
   <br/>
   They were going to the church to be married
   <br/>
   He was pressed and sent to sea
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She dressed herself up like a sailor
   <br/>
   On her breast she wore a star
   <br/>
   Her beautiful fingers long and slender
   <br/>
   She gave them all just a smear of tar
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   On this ship there being a skirmish
   <br/>
   She being one amongst the rest
   <br/>
   A silver button flew off her jacket
   <br/>
   There appeared her snow white breast
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Says the captain to this fair maid
   <br/>
   "What misfortune took you here?"
   <br/>
   "I'm in search of my true lover
   <br/>
   Whom you pressed on the other year"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "If you're in search of your true lover
   <br/>
   Pray, come tell to me his name"
   <br/>
   "Willie Taylor they do call him
   <br/>
   But Fitzgerald is his name"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Let you get up tomorrow morning
   <br/>
   Early as the break of day
   <br/>
   There you'll find your Willie Taylor
   <br/>
   Walking along with his lady gay"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She got up the very next morning
   <br/>
   Early as the break of day
   <br/>
   There she spied her Willie Taylor
   <br/>
   Walking along with his lady gay
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She drew out a brace of pistols
   <br/>
   That she had at her command
   <br/>
   There she shot her Willie Taylor
   <br/>
   With his bride at his right hand
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
