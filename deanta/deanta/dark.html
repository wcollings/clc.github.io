  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The maidens of beauty and swains so forlorn
   <br/>
   That carelessly wander away from your home
   <br/>
   I am off by the moonlight and break of the morning
   <br/>
   I'll be found in the mountains of dark Iniseoghain
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I strayed to a place they call sweet Clonmany
   <br/>
   In search of a fair one that I might adore
   <br/>
   But a maiden to love me, I couldn't find any
   <br/>
   From Meendoran Bridge to the Gap of Mamore
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Many's the Colleen I cast my eye over
   <br/>
   From Mary of Malin to the Rose of Moville
   <br/>
   All sweet were their smiles and eyes filled with laughter
   <br/>
   But sure in the end was myself waiting still
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   At the Bay of Culdaff where the wild waves are breaking
   <br/>
   Carndonagh with forest-clad mountains and hills
   <br/>
   I sat, but in vain with a heart that was aching
   <br/>
   For one whom my dreams of a bride would fulfill
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But then in the shades of old Barnan I found you
   <br/>
   That valley o'ershadowed by mountains so grand
   <br/>
   And I prayed that God's angels would ever protect you
   <br/>
   And I placed a keepsake in your little white hand
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And now I am stationed in County Fermanagh
   <br/>
   Far from the fair one that I do adore
   <br/>
   But when I return it will be to my dear one
   <br/>
   That I left in the mountains of dark Iniseoghain
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
