  <p align="center">
   You brave Irish heroes where'er you may be
   <br/>
   I pray, stand a moment and listen to me
   <br/>
   Your sons and fair daughters are all going away
   <br/>
   And thousands are sailing to Americay
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So good luck to those people and safe may they land
   <br/>
   They are leaving their country for a far distant strand
   <br/>
   They are leaving old Ireland, no longer can stay
   <br/>
   And thousands are sailing to Americay
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Now the night before leaving they are bidding good-bye
   <br/>
   And it's early next morning their hearts give a sigh
   <br/>
   They turn, kiss their mothers and then they will say
   <br/>
   "Farewell, dear old father, we must now go away"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh I pity the mother who rears up the child
   <br/>
   And likewise the father who labors and toils
   <br/>
   To try to support them, he will work night and day
   <br/>
   And when they are reared up they will go away
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So good luck to those people and safe may they land
   <br/>
   They are leaving their country for a far distant strand
   <br/>
   They are leaving old Ireland, no longer can stay
   <br/>
   And thousands are sailing to Americay
  </p>
