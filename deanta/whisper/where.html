    Chorus

   :
   <br/>
   Where are you tonight, I wonder?
   <br/>
   And where will you be tonight when I cry?
   <br/>
   Will sleep to you come easy, though alone I can't slumber?
   <br/>
   Or will you welcome in the morning at another one's side?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   How easy for you the years slip under
   <br/>
   And left me a shadow the sun can't dispel
   <br/>
   I have built for you a tower of love and admiration
   <br/>
   I see you so high I cannot reach myself
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I look through my window at a world filled with strangers
   <br/>
   The face in my mirror is the one face I know
   <br/>
   You have taken all that's in me, though my heart is in no danger
   <br/>
   My heart is in no danger, but I'd still like to know
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   If there's a silence, then it can be broken
   <br/>
   If there beats a pure heart, it's there I will go
   <br/>
   And time will work its healing, and the spirit will grow stronger
   <br/>
   But oh, in the meantime, I'd still like to know
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Where are you?
   <br/>
   Oh where are you?
   <br/>
   Where are you?
  </p>
