    As Willie and Mary met by the seaside
    <br/>
    A long farewell for to take
    <br/>
    Said Mary to Willie, "If you go away
    <br/>
    I'm afraid my poor heart, it might break"
    <br/>
    "Oh don't be afraid, dearest Mary," he said
    <br/>
    As he clasped his fond maid to his side
    <br/>
    "In my absence don't mourn, for when I return
    <br/>
    I will make you, sweet Mary, my bride"
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    Seven long years had passed and no word at last
    <br/>
    Mary stood by her own cottage door
    <br/>
    A beggar came by with a patch on his eye
    <br/>
    Bedraggled and ragged and tore
    <br/>
    "Your charity, fair maid, bestow upon me
    <br/>
    Your fortune I'll tell you beside
    <br/>
    Your lad that you mourn will never return
    <br/>
    To make little Mary his bride"
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    She slipped and she started, saying, "All that I have
    <br/>
    It's freely to you I will give
    <br/>
    If you tell me true what I now ask of you
    <br/>
    Is my Willie dead or alive?"
    <br/>
    "He's living," said he, "though in sad poverty
    <br/>
    And shipwrecked he has been beside
    <br/>
    When he'd money untold and pockets of gold
    <br/>
    He'd have made little Mary his bride"
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    "Then if he is dead, no other I'll wed
    <br/>
    No other I'll have by my side
    <br/>
    For in riches though rolled or covered with gold
    <br/>
    He'd have made his own Mary his bride"
    <br/>
    Then the patch off his eye the old beggar let fly
    <br/>
    His old coat and crutches beside
    <br/>
    And in sailor's blue clothes and with cheeks like the rose
    <br/>
    It was Willie who stood by her side
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    "Oh don't be afraid, dearest Mary," he said
    <br/>
    "It was only your faith that I tried
    <br/>
    To the church we'll away by the break of the day
    <br/>
    And I'll make little Mary my bride"
   </font>
