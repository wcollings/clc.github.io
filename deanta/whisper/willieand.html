   As Willie and Mary met by the seaside
   <br/>
   A long farewell for to take
   <br/>
   Said Mary to Willie, "If you go away
   <br/>
   I'm afraid my poor heart, it might break"
   <br/>
   "Oh don't be afraid, dearest Mary," he said
   <br/>
   As he clasped his fond maid to his side
   <br/>
   "In my absence don't mourn, for when I return
   <br/>
   I will make you, sweet Mary, my bride"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Seven long years had passed and no word at last
   <br/>
   Mary stood by her own cottage door
   <br/>
   A beggar came by with a patch on his eye
   <br/>
   Bedraggled and ragged and tore
   <br/>
   "Your charity, fair maid, bestow upon me
   <br/>
   Your fortune I'll tell you beside
   <br/>
   Your lad that you mourn will never return
   <br/>
   To make little Mary his bride"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She slipped and she started, saying, "All that I have
   <br/>
   It's freely to you I will give
   <br/>
   If you tell me true what I now ask of you
   <br/>
   Is my Willie dead or alive?"
   <br/>
   "He's living," said he, "though in sad poverty
   <br/>
   And shipwrecked he has been beside
   <br/>
   When he'd money untold and pockets of gold
   <br/>
   He'd have made little Mary his bride"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Then if he is dead, no other I'll wed
   <br/>
   No other I'll have by my side
   <br/>
   For in riches though rolled or covered with gold
   <br/>
   He'd have made his own Mary his bride"
   <br/>
   Then the patch off his eye the old beggar let fly
   <br/>
   His old coat and crutches beside
   <br/>
   And in sailor's blue clothes and with cheeks like the rose
   <br/>
   It was Willie who stood by her side
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Oh don't be afraid, dearest Mary," he said
   <br/>
   "It was only your faith that I tried
   <br/>
   To the church we'll away by the break of the day
   <br/>
   And I'll make little Mary my bride"
  </p>
