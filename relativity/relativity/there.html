  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There was a lady in her father's garden
   <br/>
   A brisk young sailor came passing by
   <br/>
   He stood awhile and he gazed upon her
   <br/>
   And he said, "Young lady, won't you marry I?"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "I'm not a lady but a poor wee girl
   <br/>
   And a poor wee girl of low degree
   <br/>
   Therefore, young man, you may try some other
   <br/>
   For a servant girl, I'm not fit to thee"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Oh I have houses and great big living
   <br/>
   And plenty money for to set you free
   <br/>
   If you'll come home, I'll make you my own
   <br/>
   And you'll have servants to wait on thee"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "It's seven years since I had a sweetheart
   <br/>
   And seven more since I did him see
   <br/>
   Seven years I will wait upon him
   <br/>
   For if he's alive he'll come home to me"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "It's seven years since you had a sweetheart
   <br/>
   And seven more since you did him see
   <br/>
   Seven more you will wait upon him
   <br/>
   Perhaps this young man you might never see"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Oh if he's sick I wish him better
   <br/>
   Or if he's dead I wish him rest
   <br/>
   But if he's alive I will wait upon him
   <br/>
   For he is the young man that I love best"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He put his hand into his pockets
   <br/>
   His lily-white fingers being thin and small
   <br/>
   And up he came and he pulls a gold ring
   <br/>
   And when she saw it, she damn did fall
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He lifted her up into his arms
   <br/>
   And gave her kisses quite tenderly
   <br/>
   Saying, "I'm your young and your single sailor
   <br/>
   And been many years on the ocean tossed"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Well, if you're my young and single sailor
   <br/>
   Your face and features seem strange to me
   <br/>
   But seven years makes great alteration
   <br/>
   And the raging seas between you and I"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So come all you fair and tender maidens
   <br/>
   Don't slight your sailors whilst they're at sea
   <br/>
   When they come home, they'll make you their own
   <br/>
   And they'll bring you o'er to Americay
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
