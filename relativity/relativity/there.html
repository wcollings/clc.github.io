    There was a lady in her father's garden
    <br/>
    A brisk young sailor came passing by
    <br/>
    He stood awhile and he gazed upon her
    <br/>
    And he said, "Young lady, won't you marry I?"
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    "I'm not a lady but a poor wee girl
    <br/>
    And a poor wee girl of low degree
    <br/>
    Therefore, young man, you may try some other
    <br/>
    For a servant girl, I'm not fit to thee"
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    "Oh I have houses and great big living
    <br/>
    And plenty money for to set you free
    <br/>
    If you'll come home, I'll make you my own
    <br/>
    And you'll have servants to wait on thee"
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    "It's seven years since I had a sweetheart
    <br/>
    And seven more since I did him see
    <br/>
    Seven years I will wait upon him
    <br/>
    For if he's alive he'll come home to me"
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    "It's seven years since you had a sweetheart
    <br/>
    And seven more since you did him see
    <br/>
    Seven more you will wait upon him
    <br/>
    Perhaps this young man you might never see"
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    "Oh if he's sick I wish him better
    <br/>
    Or if he's dead I wish him rest
    <br/>
    But if he's alive I will wait upon him
    <br/>
    For he is the young man that I love best"
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    He put his hand into his pockets
    <br/>
    His lily-white fingers being thin and small
    <br/>
    And up he came and he pulls a gold ring
    <br/>
    And when she saw it, she damn did fall
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    He lifted her up into his arms
    <br/>
    And gave her kisses quite tenderly
    <br/>
    Saying, "I'm your young and your single sailor
    <br/>
    And been many years on the ocean tossed"
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    "Well, if you're my young and single sailor
    <br/>
    Your face and features seem strange to me
    <br/>
    But seven years makes great alteration
    <br/>
    And the raging seas between you and I"
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    So come all you fair and tender maidens
    <br/>
    Don't slight your sailors whilst they're at sea
    <br/>
    When they come home, they'll make you their own
    <br/>
    And they'll bring you o'er to Americay
   </font>
