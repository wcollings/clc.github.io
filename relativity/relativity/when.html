  <p align="center">
   'Twas a cold winter's night and the tempest was stormy
   <br/>
   The snow like a sheet covered cabin and side
   <br/>
   When Barney flew over the hills to his darling
   <br/>
   He tapped at her window, where Katie did lie
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Adieu," said he, "Are you sleeping or waking?
   <br/>
   The night's bitter cold and my coat, it is thin
   <br/>
   For the storm, it is brewing, and the frost is a-waiting
   <br/>
   Oh Katie Mavarney, you must let me in"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Barney," cried she, she spoke through the window
   <br/>
   "How could you be taking me out of my bed?
   <br/>
   To come at this time is a sin and a shame, sir
   <br/>
   It's whisky, not love, that's got into your head"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "A chuisle," cried he, "It's my heart as a fountain
   <br/>
   That weeps for the love that might lay at your door
   <br/>
   Your name is more white than the snow on the mountain
   <br/>
   Barney will die to preserve it as pure
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I'll go to my home though the winter winds face me
   <br/>
   I'll whistle the notes for I'm __
   <br/>
   And the words of my Kathy will comfort and __ me
   <br/>
   'Oh Barney, a mhuirnín, I won't let you in'"
  </p>
