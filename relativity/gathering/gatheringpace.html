  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It's on a day like today when time's in the wind
   <br/>
   To be blown away, and it's easy to forget
   <br/>
   At a time like this, that momentary phrase
   <br/>
   Can last, can last me for days
   <br/>
   And your words are not new, but somehow they'll do
   <br/>
   For what you have to say
   <br/>
   Will take, will take my heart away
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And what seemed right for this song
   <br/>
   I've found to be here in you all along
   <br/>
   And the movement comes free
   <br/>
   As you're nearer to me
   <br/>
   And your voice brings out a sound
   <br/>
   That turns everything, everything around
   <br/>
   And your words are not grace
   <br/>
   But their pattern's like lace
   <br/>
   And I look on your face
   <br/>
   And things are gathering, gathering pace
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
