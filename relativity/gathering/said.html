   Said Johnny to Molly
   <br/>
   "I am now going to leave you
   <br/>
   And do not be grieved
   <br/>
   At my going away
   <br/>
   For the more we are parted
   <br/>
   We'll always be true-hearted
   <br/>
   And again I'll return
   <br/>
   In the sweet month of May"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Said Molly to Johnny
   <br/>
   "Oh I will mourn for you
   <br/>
   And I will be grieved
   <br/>
   At your going away
   <br/>
   For you know very well that
   <br/>
   Your absence does grieve me
   <br/>
   I'm afraid you would die
   <br/>
   In some strange country
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I'll dress myself up
   <br/>
   Like a neat little sea boy
   <br/>
   Amidst awful dangers
   <br/>
   I will stand your friend
   <br/>
   And when that the lofty
   <br/>
   High winds are a-blowing
   <br/>
   My dear, I'll be with you
   <br/>
   To plow the rough main"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Your two little hands, love
   <br/>
   Our ropes could not handle
   <br/>
   Your two little feet, love
   <br/>
   Our decks could not stand
   <br/>
   Nor the cold nights of winter
   <br/>
   You ne'er could endure them
   <br/>
   So stay at home, darling
   <br/>
   To the seas, do not go"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Her two little arms 'round
   <br/>
   His neck she entwined them
   <br/>
   And the clear crystal tears
   <br/>
   From her eyes they did flow
   <br/>
   And her lily-white hands
   <br/>
   On the decks she kept ringing
   <br/>
   Crying, "Oh my beloved
   <br/>
   Will I ne'er see you more?"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Come all you pretty fair maids
   <br/>
   That's inclined to marry
   <br/>
   Oh never to place your
   <br/>
   Affections on the one
   <br/>
   For first they will court you
   <br/>
   And then they'll deceive you
   <br/>
   They will leave you as I'm left
   <br/>
   To mourn when they're gone
  </p>

  </cleaned>
