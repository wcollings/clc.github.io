  <p align="center">
   Broken-hearted I'll wander
   <br/>
   For the loss of my lover
   <br/>
   He is my bonny light horseman
   <br/>
   In the wars he was slain
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When Boney commanded his armies to stand
   <br/>
   He leveled his cannon right over the land
   <br/>
   He leveled his cannon his victory to gain
   <br/>
   And slew my light horseman on the way coming in
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Broken-hearted I'll wander
   <br/>
   Broken-hearted I'll remain
   <br/>
   Since my bonny light horseman
   <br/>
   In the wars he was slain
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And if I was a small bird and had wings to fly
   <br/>
   I would fly o'er the salt seas to where my love does lie
   <br/>
   And with my fond wings I'd beat over his grave
   <br/>
   And kiss the pale lips that lie cold in the clay
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, the dove, she laments for her mate as she flies
   <br/>
   "Tell me where, tell me where is my true love," she cries
   <br/>
   And where in this wide world is there one to compare
   <br/>
   With my bonny light horseman who was slain in the war
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When Boney commanded his armies to stand
   <br/>
   He leveled his cannon right over the land
   <br/>
   He leveled his cannon his victory to gain
   <br/>
   And slew my light horseman on the way coming in
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Broken-hearted I'll wander
   <br/>
   For the loss of my lover
   <br/>
   He is my bonny light horseman
   <br/>
   In the wars he was slain
  </p>
