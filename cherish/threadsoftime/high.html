  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Woe be to the orders that took my love away
   <br/>
   And woe be to the cruel cause that bid my tears to fall
   <br/>
   Woe be to the bloody wars of high Germany
   <br/>
   They have taken my love and left a broken heart to me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The drum beat in the morning before the break of day
   <br/>
   And the small wee fife played loud and clear while yet the morn was gray
   <br/>
   And I the bonny flag unfurled, 'twas a gallant sight to see
   <br/>
   Woe to me, my soldier lad was marched to Germany
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Long, long is the traveling to the bonny pier of Leith
   <br/>
   And bleak it was to gang there with a snowstorm in your teeth
   <br/>
   And aye, the wind blew sharp and strong, and a tear rose in my eyne
   <br/>
   I gang there to see my love embark for Germany
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   As I gazed over the cruel, cruel sea for as long as could be seen
   <br/>
   The wee small sails upon the ship my own true love was in
   <br/>
   And aye, the wind blew sharp and strong, and the ship sailed speedily
   <br/>
   Cruel the raging wars have torn my bonny boy from me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Woe be to the orders that took my love away
   <br/>
   And woe be to the cruel cause that bid my tears to fall
   <br/>
   Woe be to the bloody wars of high Germany
   <br/>
   They have taken my love and left a broken heart to me
  </p>
