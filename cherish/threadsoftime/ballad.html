     Lyrics

    :
   </b>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Lay me in a cushioned chair
   <br/>
   Carry me, ye four
   <br/>
   With cushions here and there
   <br/>
   To see the world once more
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   To stable and kennel go
   <br/>
   Bring what there's to bring
   <br/>
   Lead my Lollard to and fro
   <br/>
   Or gently in a ring
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Put the chair upon the grass
   <br/>
   Bring Rody and his hounds
   <br/>
   That I may contented pass
   <br/>
   From these earthly bounds
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   His eyelids, they droop
   <br/>
   Eyes cloud with dreams
   <br/>
   The sun upon all things that grow
   <br/>
   Falls in sleepy dreams
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Huntsmen, blow the horn, come make the hills reply
   <br/>
   Loosen on the morn a gay wandering cry
   <br/>
   Rody, blow the horn, come make the hills reply
   <br/>
   I cannot blow my horn, but only weep and sigh
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Lollard treads upon the lawn
   <br/>
   And to the armchair goes
   <br/>
   The old man's dreams are gone
   <br/>
   He smoothes the long, brown nose
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Moves a pleasant tongue
   <br/>
   Upon his wasted hands
   <br/>
   Aged hounds and young
   <br/>
   The huntsman near him stands
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   'Round his cushioned place
   <br/>
   With new sorrow wrung
   <br/>
   Hounds gazing on his face
   <br/>
   Aged hounds and young
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Fire is in the old man's eyes
   <br/>
   His fingers move and sway
   <br/>
   Wandering music dies
   <br/>
   You hear him feebly say
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus 2x)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The blind hound with a mournful cry
   <br/>
   Slowly lifts his head
   <br/>
   They bear the body in
   <br/>
   The hounds wail for the dead
   <br/>
   The hounds wail for the dead
   <br/>
   Wail for the dead
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
 </body>
