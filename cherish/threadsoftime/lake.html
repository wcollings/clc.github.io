  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree
   <br/>
   And a small cabin built there, of clay and wattles made
   <br/>
   Nine bean rows will I have there, and a hive for the honey bee
   <br/>
   And live alone in the bee-loud glade
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I shall have some peace there, peace comes dropping slow
   <br/>
   Dropping from the veils of the morning to where the crickets sing
   <br/>
   There midnight's all a-glimmer, and noon a purple glow
   <br/>
   And evening is full of the linnet's wing
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I will arise and go now, for always night and day
   <br/>
   I hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore
   <br/>
   While I stand on the roadway or on the pavement gray
   <br/>
   I hear it in the deep heart's core
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree
   <br/>
   And a small cabin built there, of clay and wattles made
   <br/>
   Nine bean rows will I have there, and a hive for the honey bee
   <br/>
   And live alone in the bee-loud glade
   <br/>
   And live alone in the bee-loud glade
  </p>
