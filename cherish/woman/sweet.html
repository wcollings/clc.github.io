  <p align="center">
   I met my girl at Woolwich Pier
   <br/>
   Beneath a big crane standing
   <br/>
   And oh the love I felt for her
   <br/>
   It passed all understanding
   <br/>
   Took her sailing on the river
   <br/>
   Flow, sweet river, flow
   <br/>
   London town was mine to give her
   <br/>
   Sweet Thames, flow softly
   <br/>
   Made the Thames into a crown
   <br/>
   Flow, sweet river, flow
   <br/>
   Made a brooch of Silver town
   <br/>
   Sweet Thames, flow softly
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   At London Yard I held her hand
   <br/>
   At Blackwall Point I faced her
   <br/>
   At the Isle of Dogs I kissed her mouth
   <br/>
   And tenderly embraced her
   <br/>
   Heard the bells of Greenwich ringing
   <br/>
   Flow, sweet river, flow
   <br/>
   After that my heart was singing
   <br/>
   Sweet Thames, flow softly
   <br/>
   Lighthouse Reach I gave her there
   <br/>
   Flow, sweet river, flow
   <br/>
   As a ribbon for her hair
   <br/>
   Sweet Thames, flow softly
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   From Putney Bridge to Nine Elms Reach
   <br/>
   We cheek to cheek were dancing
   <br/>
   Her necklace made of London Bridge
   <br/>
   Her beauty was enhancing
   <br/>
   Kissed her once again at Wapping
   <br/>
   Flow, sweet river, flow
   <br/>
   After that there was no stopping
   <br/>
   Sweet Thames, flow softly
   <br/>
   Gave her Hampton Court to twist
   <br/>
   Flow, sweet river, flow
   <br/>
   As a bracelet for her wrist
   <br/>
   Sweet Thames, flow softly
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And now alas the tide has changed
   <br/>
   My love, she has gone from me
   <br/>
   And winter's frost has touched my heart
   <br/>
   And put a blight upon me
   <br/>
   Creeping fog is on the river
   <br/>
   Flow, sweet river, flow
   <br/>
   Sun and moon and stars gone with her
   <br/>
   Sweet Thames, flow softly
   <br/>
   Swift the Thames runs to the sea
   <br/>
   Flow, sweet river, flow
   <br/>
   Bearing ships and part of me
   <br/>
   Sweet Thames, flow softly
   <br/>
   Sweet Thames, flow softly
  </p>
