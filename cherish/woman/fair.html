  <p align="center">
   Come all ye fair and tender ladies
   <br/>
   Take warning how you court young men
   <br/>
   They're like a star on a cloudy morning
   <br/>
   First they'll appear and then they're gone
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   They'll tell to you some loving story
   <br/>
   They'll swear to you their love is true
   <br/>
   Straightway they'll go and court another
   <br/>
   And that's the love they had for you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh don't you remember our days of courting?
   <br/>
   You told me that you would love me the best
   <br/>
   You could make me believe by the fall of your eyes
   <br/>
   That the sun rose in the west
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   If I had known before I courted
   <br/>
   That love was such a killing thing
   <br/>
   I'd lock my heart in a box of golden
   <br/>
   And fasten it with a silver pin
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I wish I was a little sparrow
   <br/>
   And I had wings and I could fly
   <br/>
   I'd fly right home to my false true lover
   <br/>
   And when he'd ask, I would deny
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But I am not some little sparrow
   <br/>
   And I've no wings and I can't fly
   <br/>
   So I'll stay right here with my grief and sorrow
   <br/>
   And let my troubles pass me by
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Come all ye fair and tender ladies
   <br/>
   Take warning how you court young men
   <br/>
   They're like a star on a cloudy morning
   <br/>
   First they'll appear and then they're gone
   <br/>
   (2x)
