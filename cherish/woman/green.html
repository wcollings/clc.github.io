  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Farewell to the groves of shillelagh and shamrock
   <br/>
   Farewell to the wee girls of old Ireland all 'round
   <br/>
   May their hearts be as merry as ever I would wish them
   <br/>
   When far, far away across the ocean I'm bound
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh my father is old, and my mother is quite feeble
   <br/>
   To leave their own country, it grieves their heart sore
   <br/>
   Oh the tears in great drops down their cheeks, they are rolling
   <br/>
   To think they must die upon some foreign shore
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But what matters to me where my bones may be buried
   <br/>
   If in peace and contentment I can spend my life
   <br/>
   Oh the green fields of Canada, they daily are blooming
   <br/>
   And it's there I'll put an end to my miseries and strife
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So pack up your sea stores and tarry no longer
   <br/>
   Ten dollars a week isn't very bad pay
   <br/>
   With no taxes or tithes to devour up your wages
   <br/>
   When you're on the green fields of America
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The sheep run unshorn, and the land's gone to rushes
   <br/>
   The handyman is gone, and the winders of creels
   <br/>
   Away across the ocean go journeyman tailors
   <br/>
   And fiddlers that play out the old mountain reels
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Farewell to the dances in homes now deserted
   <br/>
   When tips struck the lightening in sparks from the floor
   <br/>
   The paving and crigging of hobnails on flagstones
   <br/>
   The tears of the old folk and shouts of encore
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   For the landlords and bailiffs in vile combination
   <br/>
   Have forced us from hearth stone and homestead away
   <br/>
   May the crowbar brigade all be doomed to damnation
   <br/>
   When we're on the green fields of America
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And it's now to conclude and to finish my story
   <br/>
   If e'er friendless Irishmen chance my way
   <br/>
   With the best in the house I will treat him and welcome
   <br/>
   At home in the green fields of America
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
 </body>
