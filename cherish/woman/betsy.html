  <p align="center">
   Oh Betsy Belle and Mary Gray, they were two bonnie lasses
   <br/>
   They biggit a bower on yon Burnside and theeked it o'er with rashes
   <br/>
   Fair Betsy Belle I loved so well and thought I ne'er could alter
   <br/>
   But Mary Gray's two cheeky eyes caused all my fancy falter
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Oh Betsy Belle and Mary Gray, they were two bonnie lasses
   <br/>
   They biggit a bower on yon Burnside and theeked it o'er with rashes
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Betsy's hair's like flaxen gold, she smiles like a May morning
   <br/>
   When Phoebus starts from Thoetus lap the hills with rays adorning
   <br/>
   White is her hair, soft is her hand, her waist and feet flow gently
   <br/>
   With every grace she can command, her lips I vow are dainty
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Mary's locks are like the crow, her eyes like diamond's glances
   <br/>
   She's aye so clean red up and raw, she kills whene'er she dances
   <br/>
   Blithe as a kid with wit and will, she's blooming, tight and tall is
   <br/>
   And guides her airs so graceful still, oh Jove, she's like thy palace
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Young Betsy Belle and Mary Gray, ye unco saer oppress us
   <br/>
   Our fancies fee between ye two, ye are such bonnie lassies
   <br/>
   Woe's me for both I cannot get, to one by law we're stinted
   <br/>
   Then I'll draw straws and take my fate and be with one contented
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh Betsy Belle and Mary Gray, they were two bonnie lassies
   <br/>
   They biggit a bower on yon Burnside and theeked it o'er with rashes
   <br/>
   But Betsy Belle nor Mary Gray could quell my fancy ever
   <br/>
   The plague came from the burrows town, it slew them both together
  </p>
