     Lyrics

  <p align="center">
   As I went out by Huntley town one evening for to fee
   <br/>
   With Bogie O' Cairnie and with him I did agree
   <br/>
   To mind his two best horses or cart or harrow or plow
   <br/>
   Or anything about farmwork that I very well should know
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Old Bogie had a daughter, her name was Isabelle
   <br/>
   She's the lily of the valley and the primrose of the dell
   <br/>
   And when she went out walking she took me for her guide
   <br/>
   Down by the burn of Cairnie for to watch the small fish glide
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When three long months were passed and gone, this lassie lost her bloom
   <br/>
   The red fell from her rosy cheeks, and her eyes began to swoon
   <br/>
   Nine long months had passed and gone, she bore to me a son
   <br/>
   And I was quickly sent for to see what could be done
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I said that I would marry her, but no, that would not do
   <br/>
   For you're not a match for my bonnie girl, and she's not a match for you
   <br/>
   Now she's married to a tinker lad that comes from Huntley town
   <br/>
   He sells pots and pans and paraffin lamps and he scours the country 'round
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Now maybe she's had a better match, Bogie can nae tell
   <br/>
   So farewell, ye lads o' Huntley town and to Bogie's bonnie belle
   <br/>
   So farewell, ye lads o' Huntley town and to Bogie's bonnie belle
  </p>
