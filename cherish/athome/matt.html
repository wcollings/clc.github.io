  <p align="center">
   There was a lord lived in this town who had a fair and lovely daughter
   <br/>
   She was courted by a handsome man who was a servant to her father
   <br/>
   But when her parents came to know, they swore they'd ban him from the island
   <br/>
   This maid, she knew that her heart would break, had she to part with young Matt Hyland
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Straightway to her love she went and then into his room to wake him
   <br/>
   Saying, "Arise, my love, and go away, this very night you will be taken
   <br/>
   I overheard my parents say, in spite of me they would transport you
   <br/>
   Arise, my love, and go away, I wish to God I'd gone before you"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   They both sat down all upon the bed all for the sight of one another
   <br/>
   And not one word did either speak 'til down her cheeks the tears did shower
   <br/>
   She laid her head upon his breast, around his neck her arms entwined then
   <br/>
   "No duke nor earl nor lord I'll wed, I'll wait for you, my own Matt Hyland"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "How can I go away, my love? How can I go without my wages?
   <br/>
   Without one penny of my own, just like some low and lonesome vagrant?"
   <br/>
   "Here's twenty guineas in bright gold, that's far much more than Father owes you
   <br/>
   Take it, love, and go away, you know right well I do adore you"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The lord conversed with his daughter fair one night above in her bed chamber
   <br/>
   Saying, "I'll give you leave for to bring him back, since there's no one can win your favor"
   <br/>
   She wrote a letter in great haste, for him her heart was still repining
   <br/>
   They brought him back, to the church they went, and made a lord of young Matt Hyland
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
