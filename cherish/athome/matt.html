<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
There was a lord lived in this town who had a fair and lovely daughter<br>
She was courted by a handsome man who was a servant to her father<br>
But when her parents came to know, they swore they'd ban him from the island<br>
This maid, she knew that her heart would break, had she to part with young Matt Hyland</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
Straightway to her love she went and then into his room to wake him<br>
Saying, "Arise, my love, and go away, this very night you will be taken<br>
I overheard my parents say, in spite of me they would transport you<br>
Arise, my love, and go away, I wish to God I'd gone before you"</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
They both sat down all upon the bed all for the sight of one another<br>
And not one word did either speak 'til down her cheeks the tears did shower<br>
She laid her head upon his breast, around his neck her arms entwined then<br>
"No duke nor earl nor lord I'll wed, I'll wait for you, my own Matt Hyland"</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
"How can I go away, my love? How can I go without my wages?<br>
Without one penny of my own, just like some low and lonesome vagrant?"<br>
"Here's twenty guineas in bright gold, that's far much more than Father owes you<br>
Take it, love, and go away, you know right well I do adore you"</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
The lord conversed with his daughter fair one night above in her bed chamber<br>
Saying, "I'll give you leave for to bring him back, since there's no one can win your favor"<br>
She wrote a letter in great haste, for him her heart was still repining<br>
They brought him back, to the church they went, and made a lord of young Matt Hyland</font></p></body>
