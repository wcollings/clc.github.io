   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    There was a lord lived in this town who had a fair and lovely daughter
    <br/>
    She was courted by a handsome man who was a servant to her father
    <br/>
    But when her parents came to know, they swore they'd ban him from the island
    <br/>
    This maid, she knew that her heart would break, had she to part with young Matt Hyland
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    Straightway to her love she went and then into his room to wake him
    <br/>
    Saying, "Arise, my love, and go away, this very night you will be taken
    <br/>
    I overheard my parents say, in spite of me they would transport you
    <br/>
    Arise, my love, and go away, I wish to God I'd gone before you"
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    They both sat down all upon the bed all for the sight of one another
    <br/>
    And not one word did either speak 'til down her cheeks the tears did shower
    <br/>
    She laid her head upon his breast, around his neck her arms entwined then
    <br/>
    "No duke nor earl nor lord I'll wed, I'll wait for you, my own Matt Hyland"
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    "How can I go away, my love? How can I go without my wages?
    <br/>
    Without one penny of my own, just like some low and lonesome vagrant?"
    <br/>
    "Here's twenty guineas in bright gold, that's far much more than Father owes you
    <br/>
    Take it, love, and go away, you know right well I do adore you"
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    The lord conversed with his daughter fair one night above in her bed chamber
    <br/>
    Saying, "I'll give you leave for to bring him back, since there's no one can win your favor"
    <br/>
    She wrote a letter in great haste, for him her heart was still repining
    <br/>
    They brought him back, to the church they went, and made a lord of young Matt Hyland
   </font>
