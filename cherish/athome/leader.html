<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua"><b><u>Lyrics</u>:</b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
An only child, alone and wild, a cabinet maker's son<br>
His hands were meant for different work, and his heart was known to none<br>
He left his home and went his lone and solitary way<br>
He gave to me a gift I know I never can repay</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
A quiet man of the music denied a simpler fate<br>
He tried to be a soldier once, but his music wouldn't wait<br>
He earned his love through discipline, a thundering velvet hand<br>
And his gentle means of sculpting souls took me years to understand</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
The leader of the band is tired, and his eyes are growing old<br>
His blood runs through my instrument, his song is in my soul<br>
My life has been a poor attempt to imitate the man<br>
I'm just a living legacy to the leader of the band</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
My brothers' lives were different, for they heard another call<br>
One went to Chicago and the other to St. Paul<br>
Now I'm in Colorado when I'm not in some motel<br>
Living out this life I chose and have come to know so well</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
I thank you for the music and the stories of the road<br>
I thank you for the freedom when it came my time to go<br>
I thank you for the kindness, the times when you were tough<br>
Sometimes I don't think I said "I love you" near enough</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
The leader of the band is tired, and his eyes are growing old<br>
His blood runs through my instrument, his song is in my soul<br>
My life has been a poor attempt to imitate the man<br>
I'm just a living legacy to the leader of the band</font></p></body>
