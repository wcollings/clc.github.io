     Lyrics

  </p>
  <p align="center">
   An only child, alone and wild, a cabinet maker's son
   <br/>
   His hands were meant for different work, and his heart was known to none
   <br/>
   He left his home and went his lone and solitary way
   <br/>
   He gave to me a gift I know I never can repay
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   A quiet man of the music denied a simpler fate
   <br/>
   He tried to be a soldier once, but his music wouldn't wait
   <br/>
   He earned his love through discipline, a thundering velvet hand
   <br/>
   And his gentle means of sculpting souls took me years to understand
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The leader of the band is tired, and his eyes are growing old
   <br/>
   His blood runs through my instrument, his song is in my soul
   <br/>
   My life has been a poor attempt to imitate the man
   <br/>
   I'm just a living legacy to the leader of the band
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   My brothers' lives were different, for they heard another call
   <br/>
   One went to Chicago and the other to St. Paul
   <br/>
   Now I'm in Colorado when I'm not in some motel
   <br/>
   Living out this life I chose and have come to know so well
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I thank you for the music and the stories of the road
   <br/>
   I thank you for the freedom when it came my time to go
   <br/>
   I thank you for the kindness, the times when you were tough
   <br/>
   Sometimes I don't think I said "I love you" near enough
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The leader of the band is tired, and his eyes are growing old
   <br/>
   His blood runs through my instrument, his song is in my soul
   <br/>
   My life has been a poor attempt to imitate the man
   <br/>
   I'm just a living legacy to the leader of the band
  </p>
