  <p align="center">
   When midnight comes, good people, homeward tread
   <br/>
   Seek now your blankets and your feather bed
   <br/>
   Home is the rover, his journey's over
   <br/>
   Yield up the nighttime to old John of Dreams
   <br/>
   Yield up the nighttime to old John of Dreams
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Across the hills the sun has gone astray
   <br/>
   Tomorrow's cares are many dreams away
   <br/>
   The stars are flying, the wind is sighing
   <br/>
   Yield up the darkness to old John of Dreams
   <br/>
   Yield up the darkness to old John of Dreams
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Both man and master in the night are one
   <br/>
   All things are equal when the day is done
   <br/>
   The prince and the plowman, the slave and the freeman
   <br/>
   All find their comfort in old John of Dreams
   <br/>
   All find their comfort in old John of Dreams
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Now as you sleep the dreams come winging clear
   <br/>
   The hawks of morning cannot harm you here
   <br/>
   Sleep is a river, flows on forever
   <br/>
   And for your boatman choose old John of Dreams
   <br/>
   And for your boatman choose old John of Dreams
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When midnight comes, good people, homeward tread
   <br/>
   Seek now your blanket and your feather bed
   <br/>
   Home is the rover, his journey's over
   <br/>
   Yield up the nighttime to old John of Dreams
   <br/>
   Yield up the nighttime to old John of Dreams
   <br/>
   Home is the rover, his journey's over
   <br/>
   Yield up the nighttime to old John of Dreams
   <br/>
   Yield up the nighttime to old John of Dreams
