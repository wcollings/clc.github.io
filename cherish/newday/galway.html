  <p align="center">
   I've the face of a stranger with a smile of a rover
   <br/>
   I'll take a glass at down Kinvara and a jug at Oughterard
   <br/>
   Down the great donkey roads though the hills of Connemara
   <br/>
   To my dark Spanish handsome love way down in Galway town
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus (after each verse)
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Where Jimmy is me love, he's me pride, he's me darling
   <br/>
   Jimmy leaves me wander to the ends of the world
   <br/>
   Jimmy brings me love, gives me hope and sets me dreaming
   <br/>
   And when the leaves are turning, in his arms I'll settle down in Galway town
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The spring brings the swallow, a fresh land of the rover
   <br/>
   Where the blushing summer roses shed their petals to the glen
   <br/>
   And the long breathless evenings where the loneliness is heaven
   <br/>
   Makes the dreaming come so easy on the road to Galway town
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The curlew are calling, a shy form is prancing
   <br/>
   All the ferns on them bulbing by the thousand gentle eyes
   <br/>
   All the creatures of Eireann sing their own sweet songs of pleasure
   <br/>
   As the rover goes a-whistling down the road to Galway town
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Where he's me love, he's me pride, he's me darling
   <br/>
   Jimmy leaves me wander to the ends of the world
   <br/>
   Jimmy brings me love, gives me hope and sets me dreaming
   <br/>
   And when the leaves are turning, in his arms I'll settle down in Galway town
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
