  <p align="center">
   A tall tree, turn and face the west
   <br/>
   Oh we're running with the wind
   <br/>
   On high cliff top we're waiting with the rest
   <br/>
   For this journey to begin
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus (after each verse)
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   And these broken wings won't fly
   <br/>
   These broken wings won't fly
   <br/>
   These broken wings won't fly at all
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   See how we laugh, maybe we should crawl
   <br/>
   And beg to be excused
   <br/>
   We shout loudly, have answers to it all
   <br/>
   But we have been refused
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Girl child, you're dancing with the wind
   <br/>
   Growing with the silver trees
   <br/>
   Your young questions, you ask me what it means
   <br/>
   But I am not at ease
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   A tall tree, turn and face the west
   <br/>
   Oh we're running with the wind
   <br/>
   On high cliff top we're waiting with the rest
   <br/>
   For this journey to begin
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   These broken wings won't fly
   <br/>
   These broken wings won't fly
   <br/>
   These broken wings won't fly
  </p>
