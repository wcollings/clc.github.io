  <p align="center">
   Oh Erin gr&aacute; mo chro&iacute;, you're the dear old land to me
   <br/>
   You're the fairest that my eyes did e'er behold
   <br/>
   You're the land St. Patrick blessed, you're the bright star of the west
   <br/>
   You're that dear little isle so far away
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   At the setting of the sun, when my long day's work was done
   <br/>
   I rambled down the seashore for a walk
   <br/>
   And I being all alone I sat down upon a stone
   <br/>
   For to gaze upon the scenes of New York
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh Erin gr&aacute; mo chro&iacute;, you're the dear old land to me
   <br/>
   You're the fairest that my eyes have ever seen
   <br/>
   And if ever I go home, it's from you I never will roam
   <br/>
   You're my own native land so far away
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   With the turf fire burning bright on a cold dark winter's night
   <br/>
   And the snowflakes falling gently to the ground
   <br/>
   When St. Patrick's Day has come, my thoughts will carry me home
   <br/>
   To that dear little isle so far away
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh and Erin gr&aacute; mo chro&iacute;, you're the dear old land to me
   <br/>
   You're the fairest that my eyes have ever seen
   <br/>
   You're the land St. Patrick blessed, you're the bright star of the west
   <br/>
   You're that dear little isle so far away
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   On the day that I did part, well, it broke my mother's heart
   <br/>
   Will I ever see my dear ones anymore?
   <br/>
   Not until my bones are laid in the cold and silent grave
   <br/>
   In my own native land so far away
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh Erin gr&aacute; mo chro&iacute;, you're the dear old land to me
   <br/>
   You're the fairest that my eyes have ever seen
   <br/>
   And if ever I go home, it's from you I never will roam
   <br/>
   You're my own native land so far away
   <br/>
   You're my own native land so far away
  </p>
