  <p align="center">
   I'm a freeborn man of the traveling people
   <br/>
   Got no fixed abode, with nomads I have wandered
   <br/>
   Country lanes and byways were always my ways
   <br/>
   I never fancied being numbered
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh we knew the woods and the resting places
   <br/>
   And the small birds sang when winter days were over
   <br/>
   Then we'd pack our load and be on the road
   <br/>
   Those were good old days for the rover
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   All you freeborn men of the traveling people
   <br/>
   Every tinker, rolling stone and gypsy rover
   <br/>
   Winds of change are blowing, old ways are going
   <br/>
   Your traveling days will soon be over
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There was open ground where a man could linger
   <br/>
   For a week or two, for time was not our master
   <br/>
   Then away we'd jog with our horse and dog
   <br/>
   Nice and easy, no need to go faster
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, I've known life hard and I've known it easy
   <br/>
   And I've cursed the life when winter days were dawning
   <br/>
   But I've laughed and sung through the whole night long
   <br/>
   Seen the summer sunrise in the morning
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   All you freeborn men of the traveling people
   <br/>
   Every tinker, rolling stone and gypsy rover
   <br/>
   Winds of change are blowing, old ways are going
   <br/>
   Your traveling days will soon be over
   <br/>
   Your traveling days will soon be over
  </p>
