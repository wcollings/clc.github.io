     Lyrics

  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It was down by the Glenside I met an old woman
   <br/>
   A-plucking young nettles she ne'er saw me coming
   <br/>
   I listened a while to the song she was humming
   <br/>
   Glory O, glory O, to the bold Fenian men
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   'Tis fifty long years since I saw the moon beaming
   <br/>
   On strong manly forms, gazed on eyes with hope gleaming
   <br/>
   Sure I see them again through all my day-dreaming
   <br/>
   Glory O, glory O, to the bold Fenian men
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Some died on the hillside, some died midst the stranger
   <br/>
   And wise men have told us that their cause was a failure
   <br/>
   But they loved dear old Ireland and they never feared danger
   <br/>
   Glory O, glory O, to the bold Fenian men
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I passed on my way, God be praised that I met her
   <br/>
   For be life long or short, I will never forget her
   <br/>
   For we may have brave men, but we'll never have better
   <br/>
   Glory O, glory O, to the bold Fenian men
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
