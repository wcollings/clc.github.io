   :
   <br/>
   Oh the broom, the bonnie bonnie broom
   <br/>
   Broom of the Cowdenknowes
   <br/>
   Fain would I be in the north country
   <br/>
   Herding his father's ewes
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   How blithe each morn was I to see
   <br/>
   My lad come over the hill
   <br/>
   He skipped the burn and ran to me
   <br/>
   I met him with good will
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We neither herded ewes nor lamb
   <br/>
   While the flock near us lay
   <br/>
   He gathered in the sheep at night
   <br/>
   And cheered me all the day
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Hard fate that I should banished be
   <br/>
   Gone way o'er hill and moor
   <br/>
   Because I loved the fairest lad
   <br/>
   That ever yet was born
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Adieu, ye Cowdenknowes, adieu
   <br/>
   Farewell all pleasures there
   <br/>
   To wander by his side again
   <br/>
   Is all I crave or care
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus 2x)
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
