     Lyrics

    :
   </b>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh my boat can safely float in the teeth of wind and weather
   <br/>
   And outrace the fastest hooker between Galway and Kinsale
   <br/>
   Where the white foam of the ocean and the dark clouds roll together
   <br/>
   There she rides, in her pride, like a seagull over the waves
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Oh she's neat, oh she's sweet
   <br/>
   She's a beauty in every line
   <br/>
   The Queen of Connemara
   <br/>
   She's that bounding barque of mine
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When she's loaded down with fish 'til the water lips the gunwale
   <br/>
   Not a drop she'll take on board her that would drive a fly away
   <br/>
   Like a ship she'll sail out gladly like a greyhound from his kennel
   <br/>
   And she'll land her silver store the first at ould Kinvara quay
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus 2x)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There's a light shines out afar, and it keeps me from dismaying
   <br/>
   When the sky is ink above us and the sea runs white with foam
   <br/>
   In a cot in Connemara there's a wife and wee ones praying
   <br/>
   To the One who walked the waters once, to send us safely home
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus 2x)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The Queen of Connemara
   <br/>
   She's that bounding barque of mine
  </p>
