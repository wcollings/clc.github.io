  <p align="center">
   I am a rambling Irishman
   <br/>
   In Ulster I was born and
   <br/>
   Many's the pleasant day I spent
   <br/>
   'Round the shores of sweet Loch Erne
   <br/>
   But to be poor I could not endure
   <br/>
   Like others of my station
   <br/>
   To Amerikay I sailed away
   <br/>
   And left this Irish nation
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus (after each verse)
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Rantin-de-na, tan-tin-de-na
   <br/>
   Right antin-de-na in denandy
   <br/>
   Rantin-de-na, tan-tin-de-na
   <br/>
   Right antin-de-na in denandy
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The night before he went away
   <br/>
   I spent it with my darling
   <br/>
   Three o'clock in the afternoon
   <br/>
   'Til the break of day next morning
   <br/>
   But when that we were going to part
   <br/>
   We lay in each other's arms
   <br/>
   To Amerikay he soon set sail
   <br/>
   A journey with no charms
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And when we reached the other side
   <br/>
   We were both stout and healthy
   <br/>
   We dropped the anchor in the bay
   <br/>
   Going down to Philadelphi-ay
   <br/>
   So let every lass drink to her lad
   <br/>
   In blue jacket and white trousers
   <br/>
   And let every lad drink to his lass
   <br/>
   And take them as life spouses
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I am a rambling Irishman
   <br/>
   In Ulster I was born and
   <br/>
   Many's the happy hours I spent
   <br/>
   'Round the shores of sweet Loch Erne
   <br/>
   But to be poor I could not endure
   <br/>
   Like others of my station
   <br/>
   To Amerikay I sailed away
   <br/>
   And left this Irish nation
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus 2x)
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
