  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It's of a jolly beggarman came tripping o'er the plain
   <br/>
   He came unto a farmer's door a lodging for to gain
   <br/>
   The farmer's daughter, she came down and viewed him cheek and chin
   <br/>
   She said, "He is a handsome man, I pray you take him in"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus (after each verse)
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   We'll go no more a-roving
   <br/>
   A-roving in the night
   <br/>
   We'll go no more a-roving
   <br/>
   Let the moon shine out so bright
   <br/>
   We'll go no more a-roving
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He would no lie within the barn nor yet within the byre
   <br/>
   But he would in the corner lie down by the kitchen fire
   <br/>
   Oh then the beggar's bed was made of good clean sheets and hay
   <br/>
   And down beside the kitchen fire the jolly beggar lay
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The farmer's daughter, she got up to bolt the kitchen door
   <br/>
   And there she saw the beggar standing naked on the floor
   <br/>
   He took the daughter in his hands and to the bed he ran
   <br/>
   "Kind sir," she says, "Be easy now, you'll waken our good man"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Now you are no beggar, you are some gentleman
   <br/>
   For you did steal my maidenhead, and I am quite undone"
   <br/>
   "I am no lord, I am no squire, of beggars I be one
   <br/>
   And beggars, they be robbers all, so you are quite undone"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus 2x)
  </p>
