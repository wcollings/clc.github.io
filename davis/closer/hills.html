     Lyrics

  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I came to you in the night
   <br/>
   With a soft, shallow step of sadness
   <br/>
   There you dimmed the light
   <br/>
   Of my secret, cradled madness
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You brought me in to your table
   <br/>
   You moved me from the stables
   <br/>
   Where quiet women retreat
   <br/>
   To watch the wild horses sleep
   <br/>
   And dream of
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Your words against my neck
   <br/>
   My thoughts upon your breath
   <br/>
   The mountains' cool breeze
   <br/>
   Your soft, summer ease
   <br/>
   Let me lay by your side
   <br/>
   'Til the rising morning tides
   <br/>
   They move us away
   <br/>
   To hills of another day
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The April moon came in June
   <br/>
   And brought us to the summer country
   <br/>
   Where we played the tunes
   <br/>
   Of our longing, distant memory
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The nights then all were days
   <br/>
   As you undressed my silken ways
   <br/>
   You wrapped the dusk around my shoulders
   <br/>
   And your kiss spoke of growing older
   <br/>
   To dream of
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The fall returned me to the horses
   <br/>
   With my arms ribboned in choices
   <br/>
   The women spun them in my hair
   <br/>
   As I sang of the love I'll wear
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When one day I return
   <br/>
   To my love who anon will learn
   <br/>
   That this road leads us safely
   <br/>
   Back to the fields of the summer country
   <br/>
   To dream of
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Let me lay by your side
   <br/>
   'Til the rising morning tides
   <br/>
   They move us away
   <br/>
   To hills of another day
  </p>
