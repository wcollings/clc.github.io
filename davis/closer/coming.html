  </p>
  <p align="center">
   A lifetime apart, an ocean away
   <br/>
   We thought we had left for better days
   <br/>
   But winter came and never left
   <br/>
   Our mothers cried, our fathers wept
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We were bound across the ocean
   <br/>
   She called us at night, her plains and mountains
   <br/>
   We built her homes, we sang her songs
   <br/>
   We're coming home, it's been too long
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We're coming home your sons and daughters
   <br/>
   We worked so hard, we thought of you, father
   <br/>
   And there's nothing here but more of the past
   <br/>
   With peace in our hearts, we'll be home at last
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Flowers blooming, sun is shining
   <br/>
   Night is coming, we're still smiling
   <br/>
   Oh my mother, oh my father
   <br/>
   We'll be with you in the morning
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We saw your face in the stars at night
   <br/>
   We kept our minds away from the fight
   <br/>
   We knew our future lives in tomorrow
   <br/>
   Not in the peace that you borrow
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Now our children will walk these hills
   <br/>
   To the tune of sunshine, not bloody battles
   <br/>
   We'll walk behind them, a lifetime apart
   <br/>
   They'll come home at last with peace in their hearts
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Come home, children, sleep now, children
   <br/>
   We'll be with you in the morning
   <br/>
   Peace in our hearts, peace in our lands
   <br/>
   We have buried all of your tears
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
 </body>
