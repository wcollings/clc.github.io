  <p align="center">
   I cannot sleep, my dear, tonight
   <br/>
   For the wind has left my heart in flight
   <br/>
   And the moon wanders these hills all alone
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The bells that move in the trees
   <br/>
   Are saying softly to me
   <br/>
   "Will you dream through this night all alone?"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I cannot sleep without you
   <br/>
   In the forests that we drew
   <br/>
   With colors from the streams
   <br/>
   Flowing through our dreams
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Where has my heart gone? I cannot tell
   <br/>
   Has it been sold in market stalls
   <br/>
   To beggars in search of gold on their own?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The dreams, they come and go
   <br/>
   They make their way through the snow
   <br/>
   To foggy kingdoms beyond on their own
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I've grown weary of the hearth
   <br/>
   I cannot breathe with this heart
   <br/>
   I am a winter's bride
   <br/>
   Without you by my side
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The fields that have slept in my head
   <br/>
   Have wakened the gales that have fled
   <br/>
   My thoughts that live in this love all alone
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I will wander the moors
   <br/>
   I will try every door
   <br/>
   That might lead to the cart
   <br/>
   Wheeling off my heart
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I cannot sleep, my dear, tonight
   <br/>
   For the wind has left my heart in flight
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
