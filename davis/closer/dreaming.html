  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Where has summer gone? I don't know
   <br/>
   Did she lose her way in the snow?
   <br/>
   Or does spring still hold her in his arms
   <br/>
   And whisper of his April charms?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Why did you leave me?
   <br/>
   The memories don't ease me
   <br/>
   Dreaming of you
   <br/>
   Dreaming of you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Where has summer gone? I can't say
   <br/>
   Did she come intending not to stay?
   <br/>
   And why does she wear the winter's clothes
   <br/>
   To sleep in the evening glow?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   As I moved through the trees
   <br/>
   I screamed with the leaves
   <br/>
   For dreaming of you
   <br/>
   Dreaming of you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I know you're with summer
   <br/>
   'Cause she's your lover
   <br/>
   But I'll dance through the autumn
   <br/>
   When by winter you're forgotten
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And there's no summer here, now I know
   <br/>
   So make my way through the snow
   <br/>
   To summers that bloom in my past
   <br/>
   I'm leaving yours at last
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And I will find my own voice
   <br/>
   And I will sleep through the night
   <br/>
   Without dreaming of you
   <br/>
   Dreaming of you
   <br/>
   Without dreaming of you
   <br/>
   Of you
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
