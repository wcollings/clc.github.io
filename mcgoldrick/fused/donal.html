  <p align="center">
   My Donal Og, I love you, and you sail o'er the water
   <br/>
   Take me with you to be your partner
   <br/>
   'Tis at fair and market you'll be well looked-after
   <br/>
   And you can sleep with the Greek king's daughter
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   First time I saw you 'twas a Sunday evening
   <br/>
   'Twas at the Easter as I was kneeling
   <br/>
   'Twas on Christ's passion that I was reading
   <br/>
   But my mind, it was on you, and my own heart bleeding
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   My Donal Og, you'll not find me lazy
   <br/>
   Not like some high-born expensive lady
   <br/>
   I'll do your milking and I'll nurse your baby
   <br/>
   If you were set upon I would back you bravely
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   For you said you would meet me, but you were lying
   <br/>
   Behind the sheepfold as the day was dying
   <br/>
   I whistled first, then I started hailing
   <br/>
   And all that I heard was the young lambs' wailing
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And you said you would give me, but you talk lightly
   <br/>
   Fish-skin gloves that would fit me tightly
   <br/>
   Bird-skin shoes when I go out walking
   <br/>
   A silken dress that would set Ireland talking
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   My mother, she said we should not be meeting
   <br/>
   That I should pass you by and not give you greeting
   <br/>
   'Twas a good time surely she chose for cheating
   <br/>
   With the stable bare and the horse retreating
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Black as the sloe is the heart inside me
   <br/>
   Black as the coal with the grief that drives me
   <br/>
   Black as the boot print on shining hallway
   <br/>
   'Twas you that blackened it ever and always
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   For you took what's before me and what's behind me
   <br/>
   You took east and west when you would not mind me
   <br/>
   Sun, moon and stars from me you have taken
   <br/>
   And Christ likewise if I'm not mistaken
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   My Donal Og, when you sail o'er the water
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
 </body>
