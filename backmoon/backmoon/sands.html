  <p align="center">
   I aince had a sweetheart but noo I hae nane
   <br/>
   He stole awa' my hairt, but I got it back again
   <br/>
   Aye, I got it back again, aye and sae let it be
   <br/>
   For I care nae mair for him than the waves o' the sea
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   And the sands o' the shore and the waves o' the sea
   <br/>
   When his back is turned he's a stranger tae me
   <br/>
   He's a stranger tae me, aye and sae let him be
   <br/>
   For I care nae mair for him than the waves o' the sea
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He gied tae me the praisent o' a braw diamond ring
   <br/>
   He thocht it wid entise me tae gang awa' wi' him
   <br/>
   But I wisnae as foolish as he'd taen me tae be
   <br/>
   And I care nae mair for him than the waves o' the sea
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh he is the son o' a high lord and king
   <br/>
   And I am but the daughter o' a pair workin' man
   <br/>
   So it's he'll drink his wine, and I'll drink my tea
   <br/>
   And I care nae mair for him than the waves o' the sea
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus 2x)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Still I care nae mair for him than the waves o' the sea
  </p>
