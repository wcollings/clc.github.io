  <p align="center">
   Greenland is a hell of a place
   <br/>
   It's a place that's never green
   <br/>
   Where there's ice and snow, and the whale fishes blow
   <br/>
   And the daylight's seldom seen, brave boys
   <br/>
   The daylight's seldom seen
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   In eighteen hundred and sixty-four
   <br/>
   On June the thirteen day
   <br/>
   Our gallant ship her anchor weighed
   <br/>
   And for Greenland sailed away, brave boys
   <br/>
   For Greenland sailed away
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, our captain, he stood on the quarter deck
   <br/>
   With a spy glass in his hand
   <br/>
   There's a whale, there's a whale, there's a bloody great whale
   <br/>
   And she blows on every span, brave boys
   <br/>
   She blows on every span
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We hit that whale and the line paid out
   <br/>
   And she made a flunder with her tail
   <br/>
   And the boat capsized and ten men were drowned
   <br/>
   And we ne'er did catch that whale, brave boys
   <br/>
   We ne'er did catch that whale
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, the losing of those ten brave men
   <br/>
   It grieves my heart full sore
   <br/>
   But the losing of that bloody great whale
   <br/>
   It grieves me ten times more, brave boys
   <br/>
   It grieves me ten times more
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Greenland is a hell of a place
   <br/>
   It's a place that's never green
   <br/>
   Where there's ice and snow, and the whale fishes blow
   <br/>
   And the daylight's seldom seen, brave boys
   <br/>
   The daylight's seldom seen
   <br/>
   (3x)
