  <p align="center">
   There were nine and nine nobles rade through Banchory Fair
   <br/>
   And bonny Glenlogie was the flooer o' a' there
   <br/>
   There were nine and nine nobles sat at the king's dine
   <br/>
   And bonny Glenlogie was the flooer o' twice nine
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Doon cam Jeannie Gordon, she cam trippin' doon the stair
   <br/>
   An' she's chosen Glenlogie oot o' a' that wis there
   <br/>
   She ca'd on his footpage that ran by his side
   <br/>
   Sayin', "Wha is this young man, and whaur dis he bide?"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He's styllt Glenlogie when he is at hame
   <br/>
   An' he's o' the noble Gordons, Lord John is his name
   <br/>
   Glenlogie, Glenlogie, gin ye will prove kind
   <br/>
   Oh my love is laid upon ye, noo I've tellt ye my mind
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh the Gordon turned lightly, as the Gordons does a'
   <br/>
   I thank ye, Jeannie Gordon, but I'm promised awa'
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She ca'd on her maidens tae mak her a bed
   <br/>
   Wi' ribbons and napkins tae tie up her head
   <br/>
   Oh lay me doon gently, pit my face tae the wa'
   <br/>
   Tak the rings frae my fingers, my jewels and a'
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But her faither's ain chaplin, bein' a man o' great skill
   <br/>
   Weel, he's write a braid letter and indited it weel
   <br/>
   Glenlogie, Glenlogie, gin ye are at hame
   <br/>
   Oh this lady's love's laid on ye, must she die in her prime?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When Glenlogie got the letter, he was amang men
   <br/>
   And it's oot spake Glenlogie, "What's this young woman mean?
   <br/>
   Go saddle me the black horse, go saddle me the broon
   <br/>
   Bonnie Jeannie o' Bethelnie will be deid 'ere I win"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh pale an' wan wis she as first he's gaed in
   <br/>
   But reid and rosy grew she when she kent it wis him
   <br/>
   Turn 'roon, Jeannie Gordon, turn tae yer richt side
   <br/>
   For it's I'll be yer bridegroom, if ye'll be my bride
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Noo Jeannie's got marriet, an' her tochers doon told
   <br/>
   Bonnie Jean o' Bethelnie, scarce sixteen years old
   <br/>
   Bethelnie, Bethelnie, ye shine whar ye stand
   <br/>
   May the heather bells 'roon ye shine ower this land
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Bethelnie, Bethelnie, ye shine whar ye stand
   <br/>
   May the heather bells 'roon ye shine ower Fyvie's land
  </p>
