  <p align="center">
   In Perth there lived a bonnie lad
   <br/>
   A brewer tae his trade O
   <br/>
   An' he is courted Peggie Roy
   <br/>
   A young and handsome maid O
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Wi' a fall dall diddle um a die dum doo
   <br/>
   Wi' a fall dall diddle um a die doh
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, he's courted her for seven lang years
   <br/>
   A' for tae gain her favor
   <br/>
   But there cam a lad oot a' Edinburgh toon
   <br/>
   Wha swore that he would have her
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It's will ye gang alang wi' me
   <br/>
   An' will ye be ma honey?
   <br/>
   It's will ye gang alang wi' me
   <br/>
   An' leave your brewer laddie?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh I will gang alang wi' you
   <br/>
   Alang wi' you I'll ride O
   <br/>
   I'll gang wi' you to the ends o' the earth
   <br/>
   Though I'm spoke to the brewer lad O
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh the brewer, he cam hame at een
   <br/>
   A-speirin' for his honey
   <br/>
   Her faither, he made this reply
   <br/>
   "She's no' been here since Monday"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh wasna that an uncoo' ploy
   <br/>
   Wouldna onyone be offended
   <br/>
   Tae court wi' a lad for seven lang years
   <br/>
   And leave him at the end o't
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh be it so, and let her go
   <br/>
   For it shall never grieve me
   <br/>
   I'm a lad that's free, as you can see
   <br/>
   And a sma' thing will relieve me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There's as guid fish intae the sea
   <br/>
   As ever yet was taken
   <br/>
   I'll cast ma net an' try again
   <br/>
   Although I am forsaken
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She's rambled up, she's rambled doon
   <br/>
   She's rambled through Kirkaldy
   <br/>
   Mony's the time she rued the day
   <br/>
   She jilt' her brewer laddie
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He's taen his course an' awa' he's gaen
   <br/>
   The country he has fled O
   <br/>
   He's left nae sark upon her back
   <br/>
   Nor blanket on her bed O
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The brewer, he set up in Perth
   <br/>
   And there he brews strang ale O
   <br/>
   He's courted wi' anither lass
   <br/>
   And taen her tae himsel' O
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Ye lovers a', where'er ye be
   <br/>
   Just let this be a warnin'
   <br/>
   An' never slight your ane true love
   <br/>
   For fear you get a waur ane
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus...)
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
