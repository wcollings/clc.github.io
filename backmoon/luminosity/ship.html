  <p align="center">
   We sat in his living room staring at the fire
   <br/>
   And watched as the sparks leapt from the grate, and the flames rose higher
   <br/>
   It was hard for me to tell him it was time for me to leave
   <br/>
   He said, "I didn't go see the world, I thought that it would come to me"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Pointing to the mantelpiece, he said, "Take that if you wish"
   <br/>
   A dirty whisky jar that contained a wooden ship
   <br/>
   "Your grandfather drained that bottle, and I put it to good use
   <br/>
   Now it ties me to my yesterdays, I'd be better off to lose"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   No use fighting when the wind's against the tide
   <br/>
   Ship your oars, stow your sails, just enjoy the ride of your life
   <br/>
   Or throw yourself on the mercy of the sea
   <br/>
   Whatever you do, son, don't waste your time like me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He built it back in '33, just a young boy at the time
   <br/>
   Back when the matchstick masts appeared to tower above the Clyde
   <br/>
   Leaving school, real ships he built carried men and goods afar
   <br/>
   To America and India, and in the '40s, to the war
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   His country didn't want him as his mates fell through wartorn skies
   <br/>
   The rest, they joined the convoys, still he was too young to die
   <br/>
   Now he can't even find his glasses, his hands shake too much, he knows
   <br/>
   To break the bottle for himself and to let the memories go
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Sitting on the mantelpiece, the bottle's gathered dust
   <br/>
   While shipyards closed, their gates were locked, the chains begin to rust
   <br/>
   He was tied down to his memories, forever in their debt
   <br/>
   But I'll sail for clear blue waters and a life with no regrets
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
