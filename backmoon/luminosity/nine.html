   They shot him dead at the nine stone rig beside the headless cross
   <br/>
   And they left him lying in his blood upon the moor and the moss
   <br/>
   They buried him at midnight and the dew fell cold and still
   <br/>
   And the women in gray for God to pray, and the mist clung to the hill
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh gentle wind that's blowing south from where my love repairs
   <br/>
   Convey a kiss from his dear mouth and tell me how he fairs
   <br/>
   The word was carried back to me as if by God's command
   <br/>
   Your sweetheart was murdered yesterday by your brother's jealous hand
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   No living man I'll love again since my darling went through death's door
   <br/>
   With one lock of his yellow hair I'll chain my heart forever more
   <br/>
   Oh mother dear, please make my bed and lay me down in sorrow
   <br/>
   My love, he died for me last night, and I'll die for him tomorrow
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   My love, he died for me last night, and I'll die for him tomorrow
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   They shot him dead at the nine stone rig beside the headless cross
   <br/>
   And they left him lying in his blood upon the moor and the moss
   <br/>
   They buried him at midnight and the dew fell cold and still
   <br/>
   And the women in gray for God to pray, and the mist clung to the hill
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And the women in gray for God to pray, and the mist clung to the hill
  </p>
