  <p align="center">
   Doon Deeside cam Inveray a-whistlin' an' playin'
   <br/>
   An' he cam by Brackley's yetts ere the day was dawin'
   <br/>
   "Oh are ye there, Brackley, and are ye within?
   <br/>
   Oor shairp swords are at yer yetts, an' we'll gaur your bluid spin"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Rise up, Betsy Gordon, an' gie me my gun
   <br/>
   For though I gang oot, love, sure I'll never come in
   <br/>
   Come kiss me, my Betsy, nor think I'm tae blame
   <br/>
   For though I hae ae man, I'm sure they hae ten"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When Brackley was mounted and rade on his horse
   <br/>
   A bonnier baron ne'er rade o'er a course
   <br/>
   Twa gallanter Gordons did never swords draw
   <br/>
   But against three and thirty, fa's me, whit is twa?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Wi' their dirks and their broadswords, they did him surroun'
   <br/>
   And they killed bonny Brackley wi' mony's a woun'
   <br/>
   Frae the heid o' the Dee tae the banks o' the Spey
   <br/>
   The Gordons shall mourn him and ban Inveray
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh cam ye by Brackley's yetts, an' cam ye by here?
   <br/>
   An' saw ye his lady a-rivin' her hair?
   <br/>
   Oh an' I cam by Brackley's yetts an' I cam by here
   <br/>
   An' I saw his fair lady, she wis makin' guid cheer
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She was rantin' an' dancin' an' singin' wi' joy
   <br/>
   An' vowin' that verra nicht she would feast Inveray
   <br/>
   Well, she's laughed wi' him, danced wi' him, welcomed him in
   <br/>
   She was kind tae the murderer wha had slayed her guid man
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Through hedges an' ditches ye canna be sure
   <br/>
   But through the woods at Glentor ye can slip in an hour
   <br/>
   An' it's up spak the babe sittin' on his mither's knee
   <br/>
   Sayin', "Afore I'm a man, it's avenged I'll be"
  </p>
