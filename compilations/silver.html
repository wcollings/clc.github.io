  <p align="center">
   Between the beggar's mantle and the lights o' Peterheid
   <br/>
   The fisher lads were heroes and the herrin was their creed
   <br/>
   The herrin paid the factor, the herrin fed the wean
   <br/>
   But now the herrin's gone and the fishin's no the same
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The likes o' me was put tae the sea as soon as I could stand
   <br/>
   To catch the silver darlin's for the folk upon the land
   <br/>
   Wi half a mile o' net between the bottom and the keel
   <br/>
   An' half a score o' years between the cradle and the creel
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And I mind the rigs o' barley, I mind the rigs o' rye
   <br/>
   I mind the riggin on the mast so dark against the sky
   <br/>
   But the lads that used tae work them a', they've gone for better pay
   <br/>
   And the rigs that work the oil are a' the rigs ye'll see the day
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So dinnae blame the fisher folk for takin tae the oil
   <br/>
   For if ye didnae find the fish, ye've nothing for yer toil
   <br/>
   And there's still as many families, as many mouths tae feed
   <br/>
   Between the beggar's mantle and the lights o' Peterheid
  </p>
 </body>
