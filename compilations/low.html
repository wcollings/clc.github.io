  </p>
  <p align="center">
   On the night that I was married
   <br/>
   And on my marriage bed
   <br/>
   Up came a bold sea captain
   <br/>
   And he stood at my bed head
   <br/>
   Saying, "Arise, arise, young wedded man
   <br/>
   And come along with me
   <br/>
   To the low, low lands of Holland
   <br/>
   To fight the enemy
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Now Holland is a lovely land
   <br/>
   And on it grows fine grain
   <br/>
   Sure it is a place of residence
   <br/>
   For a soldier to remain
   <br/>
   Where the sugar cane is plentiful
   <br/>
   And the tea grows on the tree
   <br/>
   I never had but the one __
   <br/>
   Now he's far away from me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Said the mother to the daughter
   <br/>
   Give off your sore lament
   <br/>
   Oh there's men enough in Galway
   <br/>
   For to be your heart's content"
   <br/>
   "If there's men enough in Galway
   <br/>
   Alas there are none for me
   <br/>
   Since these high winds and stormy seas
   <br/>
   Have come between my love and me"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I will wear no swaithe around my waist
   <br/>
   Nor combs pull in my hair
   <br/>
   No handkerchief around my neck
   <br/>
   For to save my beauty fair
   <br/>
   And never will I marry
   <br/>
   Until the day I die
   <br/>
   Since the low, low lands of Holland
   <br/>
   Have come between my love and I
  </p>
