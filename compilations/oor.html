  <p align="center">
   There was this king sittin' in his gairden aw alane
   <br/>
   When his brother in his ear pourt a wee tate o henbane
   <br/>
   Then he stole his brother's crown and his money and his widow
   <br/>
   But the deid king walked and goat his son and said, "Hey, listen, kiddo
   <br/>
   Ah've been killt and it's your duty to take revenge on Claudius
   <br/>
   Kill him quick and clean and tell the nation whit a fraud he is"
   <br/>
   The boay says, "Right, Ah'll dae it but ah'll need tae play it crafty
   <br/>
   So that naeb'dy will suspect me, Ah'll kid oan that Ah'm a dafty"
   <br/>
   Then wi aw except Horatio, and he trusts him as a friend
   <br/>
   Hamlet, that's the boay, kids oan he's roon the bend
   <br/>
   And because he wisnae ready for obligatory killin'
   <br/>
   He tried to make the king think he was tuppence aff the shillin'
   <br/>
   Took the mickey oot Polonius, treatit poor Ophelia vile
   <br/>
   Tellt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern that Denmark was a jile
   <br/>
   Then a troupe o travellin' actors, like 7:84
   <br/>
   Arrived to dae a special wan-night gig in Elsinore
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Hamlet, Hamlet loved his mammy
   <br/>
   Hamlet, Hamlet actin' balmy
   <br/>
   Hamlet, Hamlet hesitatin'
   <br/>
   Wonders if the ghost's a cheat and that is how he's waitin'
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Then Hamlet wrote a scene for the players to enact
   <br/>
   While Horatio and him would watch to see if Claudius cracked
   <br/>
   The play was ca'd The Moosetrap, no the wan that's runnin' noo
   <br/>
   Sure enough the king walked oot afore the scene was through
   <br/>
   So Hamlet's goat the proof that Claudius gi'ed his da the dose
   <br/>
   The only problem bein' noo that Claudius knows he knows
   <br/>
   So while Hamlet tells his ma that her new husband's no a fit wan
   <br/>
   Uncle Claud pits oot a contract wi the English king as hitman
   <br/>
   And when Hamlet killt Polonius the concealed Corpus Delecti
   <br/>
   Was the king's excuse to send him for an English hempen necktie
   <br/>
   Wi Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to make sure he goat there
   <br/>
   But Hamlet jumped the boat and pit the finger oan that pair
   <br/>
   Meanwhile Laertes heard his da had been stabbed through that arras
   <br/>
   He cam racin' back to Elsinore, tout-de-suite, hot-foot fae Paris
   <br/>
   Ophelia wi her da killt by the man she wished to marry
   <br/>
   Efter sayin' it wi flooers, she committit hari-kari
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Hamlet, Hamlet nae messin'
   <br/>
   Hamlet, Hamlet learnt his lesson
   <br/>
   Hamlet, Hamlet, Yorick's crust
   <br/>
   Convinced him that men, good or bad, at last must come to dust
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Then Laertes loast the place and was demandin' retribution
   <br/>
   And the king said, "Keep the heid an' Ah'll provide ye a solution"
   <br/>
   He arranged a sword fight for the interestit pairties
   <br/>
   Wi a bluntit sword for Hamlet and a shairp sword Laertes
   <br/>
   Then to make things double sure, the auld belt-and-braces line
   <br/>
   He fixed a poisont sword-tip and a poisont cup o wine
   <br/>
   The poisont sword goat Hamlet, but Laertes went an' muffed it
   <br/>
   'Cause he goat stabbed hissel and he confessed afore he snuffed it
   <br/>
   Hamlet's mammy drunk the wine and as her face turnt blue
   <br/>
   Hamlet says, "Ah quite believe the king's a baddie noo
   <br/>
   Incestuous, murderous, damn&eacute;d Dane!" he said tae be precise
   <br/>
   And made up for hesitatin' by killin' Claudius twice
   <br/>
   'Cause he stabbed him wi the sword and forced the wine atween his lips
   <br/>
   Then he cried, "The rest is silence," that was Hamlet hud his chips
   <br/>
   They firet a volley ower him that shook the topmaist rafter
   <br/>
   And Fortinbras, knee-deep in Danes, lived happy ever after
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Hamlet, Hamlet, aw the gory
   <br/>
   Hamlet, Hamlet, end of story
   <br/>
   Hamlet, Hamlet, Ah'm away
   <br/>
   If you think this is borin' ye should read the bloody play
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
