   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    There was this king sittin' in his gairden aw alane
    <br/>
    When his brother in his ear pourt a wee tate o henbane
    <br/>
    Then he stole his brother's crown and his money and his widow
    <br/>
    But the deid king walked and goat his son and said, "Hey, listen, kiddo
    <br/>
    Ah've been killt and it's your duty to take revenge on Claudius
    <br/>
    Kill him quick and clean and tell the nation whit a fraud he is"
    <br/>
    The boay says, "Right, Ah'll dae it but ah'll need tae play it crafty
    <br/>
    So that naeb'dy will suspect me, Ah'll kid oan that Ah'm a dafty"
    <br/>
    Then wi aw except Horatio, and he trusts him as a friend
    <br/>
    Hamlet, that's the boay, kids oan he's roon the bend
    <br/>
    And because he wisnae ready for obligatory killin'
    <br/>
    He tried to make the king think he was tuppence aff the shillin'
    <br/>
    Took the mickey oot Polonius, treatit poor Ophelia vile
    <br/>
    Tellt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern that Denmark was a jile
    <br/>
    Then a troupe o travellin' actors, like 7:84
    <br/>
    Arrived to dae a special wan-night gig in Elsinore
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    Hamlet, Hamlet loved his mammy
    <br/>
    Hamlet, Hamlet actin' balmy
    <br/>
    Hamlet, Hamlet hesitatin'
    <br/>
    Wonders if the ghost's a cheat and that is how he's waitin'
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    Then Hamlet wrote a scene for the players to enact
    <br/>
    While Horatio and him would watch to see if Claudius cracked
    <br/>
    The play was ca'd The Moosetrap, no the wan that's runnin' noo
    <br/>
    Sure enough the king walked oot afore the scene was through
    <br/>
    So Hamlet's goat the proof that Claudius gi'ed his da the dose
    <br/>
    The only problem bein' noo that Claudius knows he knows
    <br/>
    So while Hamlet tells his ma that her new husband's no a fit wan
    <br/>
    Uncle Claud pits oot a contract wi the English king as hitman
    <br/>
    And when Hamlet killt Polonius the concealed Corpus Delecti
    <br/>
    Was the king's excuse to send him for an English hempen necktie
    <br/>
    Wi Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to make sure he goat there
    <br/>
    But Hamlet jumped the boat and pit the finger oan that pair
    <br/>
    Meanwhile Laertes heard his da had been stabbed through that arras
    <br/>
    He cam racin' back to Elsinore, tout-de-suite, hot-foot fae Paris
    <br/>
    Ophelia wi her da killt by the man she wished to marry
    <br/>
    Efter sayin' it wi flooers, she committit hari-kari
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    Hamlet, Hamlet nae messin'
    <br/>
    Hamlet, Hamlet learnt his lesson
    <br/>
    Hamlet, Hamlet, Yorick's crust
    <br/>
    Convinced him that men, good or bad, at last must come to dust
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    Then Laertes loast the place and was demandin' retribution
    <br/>
    And the king said, "Keep the heid an' Ah'll provide ye a solution"
    <br/>
    He arranged a sword fight for the interestit pairties
    <br/>
    Wi a bluntit sword for Hamlet and a shairp sword Laertes
    <br/>
    Then to make things double sure, the auld belt-and-braces line
    <br/>
    He fixed a poisont sword-tip and a poisont cup o wine
    <br/>
    The poisont sword goat Hamlet, but Laertes went an' muffed it
    <br/>
    'Cause he goat stabbed hissel and he confessed afore he snuffed it
    <br/>
    Hamlet's mammy drunk the wine and as her face turnt blue
    <br/>
    Hamlet says, "Ah quite believe the king's a baddie noo
    <br/>
    Incestuous, murderous, damnéd Dane!" he said tae be precise
    <br/>
    And made up for hesitatin' by killin' Claudius twice
    <br/>
    'Cause he stabbed him wi the sword and forced the wine atween his lips
    <br/>
    Then he cried, "The rest is silence," that was Hamlet hud his chips
    <br/>
    They firet a volley ower him that shook the topmaist rafter
    <br/>
    And Fortinbras, knee-deep in Danes, lived happy ever after
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    Hamlet, Hamlet, aw the gory
    <br/>
    Hamlet, Hamlet, end of story
    <br/>
    Hamlet, Hamlet, Ah'm away
    <br/>
    If you think this is borin' ye should read the bloody play
