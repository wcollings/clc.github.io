  <p align="center">
   I have a feeling we're going to be in for a shock
   <br/>
   As our good mother nature gives us a knock
   <br/>
   To take the wind from our sails and the smile from our face
   <br/>
   To make us all realize our insignificant place
   <br/>
   On the surface of this life-giving lump of rock
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She's got forces at her disposal no army could muster
   <br/>
   We'll be swept cleanly aside by her celestial duster
   <br/>
   When she comes __ing with her universal spring clean
   <br/>
   We might find we'll be able to see what it means
   <br/>
   The weather, the warnings and the __
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   For centuries now we've been increasing her rage
   <br/>
   Invention, advancement, the industrial age
   <br/>
   We drill her and mine her, pillage and plunder
   <br/>
   Too few of us ever sit in silent wonder
   <br/>
   And the peoples who do we would lock in a cage
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
