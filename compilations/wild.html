  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I have been a wild rover for many's a year
   <br/>
   And I spent all my money on whiskey and beer
   <br/>
   But now I'm returning with gold and great store
   <br/>
   And I ne'er shall be called wild rover no more
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus (after each verse)
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Wild roving I'll give over
   <br/>
   Wild roving I'll give over
   <br/>
   And I ne'er shall be called wild rover no more
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I went into an alehouse I used to frequent
   <br/>
   And I told the landlady all my money was spent
   <br/>
   I asked her for credit, she answered me nay
   <br/>
   Saying, "Customers, yours I can have any day"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I went into my pockets, pulled out sovereigns bright
   <br/>
   And the landlady's eyes opened wide with delight
   <br/>
   She says, "I have whiskeys and wines of the best
   <br/>
   And the words that I spoke sure were only in jest"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I'll go back to my parents, confess what I've done
   <br/>
   And I'll ask them to pardon their prodigal son
   <br/>
   And if they caress me as ofttimes before
   <br/>
   Then I ne'er shall be called wild rover no more
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
 </body>
