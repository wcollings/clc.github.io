  <p align="center">
   I was listening to the news the other day
   <br/>
   I heard a fat politician who had the nerve to say
   <br/>
   He was proud to be Scottish, by the way
   <br/>
   With the the glories of our past to remember
   <br/>
   "Here's tae us, wha's like us?" Listen to the cry
   <br/>
   No surrender to the truth and here's the reason why
   <br/>
   The power and the glory's just another bloody lie
   <br/>
   They use to keep us all in line
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   For there's no gods and there's precious few heroes
   <br/>
   But there's plenty on the dole in the Land o' the Leal
   <br/>
   And it's time now to sweep the future clear
   <br/>
   Of the lies of a past that we know was never real
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Sae farewell to the heather an the glen
   <br/>
   They cleared us off once and they'd do it all again
   <br/>
   For they still prefer sheep to thinking men
   <br/>
   Ah but men who think like sheep are even better
   <br/>
   There's nothing much to choose between the old laird and the new
   <br/>
   They still don't give a damn for the likes of me and you
   <br/>
   Just mind ye pay your rent to the factor when it's due
   <br/>
   And mind your bloody manners when ye pay
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And tell me, will we never hear the end
   <br/>
   Of puir bluidy Charlie at Culloden yet again?
   <br/>
   Though he ran like a rabbit down the glen
   <br/>
   Leaving better folk than him to be butchered
   <br/>
   Or are you sittin in your council house dreaming o' your clan?
   <br/>
   Waitin' for the Jacobites tae come an free the land?
   <br/>
   Try goin doon the broo with your claymore in your hand
   <br/>
   And count a' the princes in the queue
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So don't talk to me of Scotland the brave
   <br/>
   For if we don't fight soon there'll be nothing left to save
   <br/>
   Or would you rather stand and watch them dig your grave
   <br/>
   While ye wait for the Tartan messiah?
   <br/>
   He'll lead us tae the promised land wi laughter in his eye
   <br/>
   We'll all live on the oil and the whisky by and by
   <br/>
   Free heavy beer, pie suppers in the sky
   <br/>
   Will we never have the sense to learn?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   That there's no gods and there's precious few heroes
   <br/>
   But there's plenty on the dole in the Land o' the Leal
   <br/>
   And I'm damn sure that there's plenty live in fear
   <br/>
   Of the day we stand together with our shoulders at the wheel
   <br/>
   Aye there's no gods
  </p>
