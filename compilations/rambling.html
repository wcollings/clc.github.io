     Lyrics

  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I am a rambling Irishman, in Ulster I was born in
   <br/>
   And many's the happy hour I spent on the banks of sweet Loch Erin
   <br/>
   But to be poor I could not endure like others of my station
   <br/>
   To Amerikay I sailed away and left this Irish nation
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus (after each verse)
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Right rantin-de-na, dantin-de-na
   <br/>
   Right antin-de-na, in-en-andy
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The night before I sailed away, I spent it with my darling
   <br/>
   From three o'clock in the afternoon 'til the break of day next morning
   <br/>
   And when that we were going to part, we lay in each other's arms
   <br/>
   And you may be sure, and very sure, it wounded both our charms
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The very first night I slept on board I dreamt about my Nancy
   <br/>
   I dreamt I held her in my arms, and well she pleased my fancy
   <br/>
   But when I awoke from my sleep and I found my bosom empty
   <br/>
   Well, you may be sure, and very sure, that I lay discontented
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When we arrived at the other side we were both stout and healthy
   <br/>
   We cast our anchor in the bay going down to Philadelphi
   <br/>
   So let every lad link with his lass, blue jacket and white trousers
   <br/>
   And let every lass link with her lad, blue petticoats and white flounces
  </p>
 </body>
