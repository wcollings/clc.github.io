  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It was on a summer's morning all in the month of May
   <br/>
   Down by yon flowery gardens I carelessly did stray
   <br/>
   I overheard a fair maid in sorrow to complain
   <br/>
   All for her absent lover who plowed the raging main
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I boldly stepped up to her and gave to her a surprise
   <br/>
   I know she did not know me, for I being in disguise
   <br/>
   I said, "My charming creature, my heart and joy's delight
   <br/>
   How far do you mean to wander this dark and dreary night?"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Kind sir, the way to Claudy, if you will please do show
   <br/>
   Oh take pity on the fair maid that knows not where to go
   <br/>
   I'm on the search of a faithless young man, Johnny is his name
   <br/>
   And along the Banks of Claudy, I'm told he does remain"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "This is the Banks of Claudy, fair maid, where on you stand
   <br/>
   Oh but don't depend on Johnny for he's a false young man
   <br/>
   Oh don't depend on Johnny, for he'll not meet you here
   <br/>
   But tarry with me in yon green wood, no danger need you fear"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It's six long weeks and better since Johnny left the shore
   <br/>
   He's crossing the wild ocean where the foam and billows roar
   <br/>
   He's crossing the wide ocean for honor and for fame
   <br/>
   But this I heard, the ship was wrecked on the fatal coast of Spain"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh it's when she heard the dreadful news, she flew into despair
   <br/>
   With the wringing of her hands and the tearing of her hair
   <br/>
   Saying, "If Johnny, he is drowned, no man on earth I'll take
   <br/>
   But through lonesome groves and valleys I'll wander for his sake
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh it's when he saw her loyalty, no longer could he stand
   <br/>
   He flew into her arms saying, "Betsy, I'm the man"
   <br/>
   Saying, "Betsy, I'm the young man, the cause of all your pain
   <br/>
   But since we've met on Claudy Banks, we'll never part again"
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
