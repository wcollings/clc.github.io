  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Far over the forth I look to the north
   <br/>
   But what is the north, wi its highlands tae me?
   <br/>
   The south, nor the east, gi ease tae my breast
   <br/>
   It's a far foreign land, o'er the wild rolling sea
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   His father, he frowned on the love of his boyhood
   <br/>
   And oh his proud mother looked cauld upon me
   <br/>
   But he ay follaed me tae ma hame in the sheelin
   <br/>
   And the Hills o' Breadalbane rang wild wi our glee
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   A' the lang summer days amang the heather and the bracken
   <br/>
   And oh for the __ o' his bonny blue ee
   <br/>
   But little I kenned that the wild western ocean
   <br/>
   Would be rolling this day between ma laddie and me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We trysted our love in the cairn on the mountain
   <br/>
   The deer and roe stood bridesmaidens tae me
   <br/>
   And my love's trysting glass was the clear crystal fountain
   <br/>
   What then was the world tae ma laddie and me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So I'll look tae the north as I look o'er the forth
   <br/>
   But what is the north, wi its highlands tae me?
   <br/>
   For the lad I loo best is far in the west
   <br/>
   And he's seeking a hame for ma bairnie and me
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
