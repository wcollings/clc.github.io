  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Ah me, I must mourn my true love evermore
   <br/>
   Though coldly forsaken, it's you adore
   <br/>
   And if you would return then I'd make you my bride
   <br/>
   Or I'll cross the wild Atlantic to be by your side
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   On the morning we parted, how sad the farewell
   <br/>
   Oh words, they were few, but our thoughts none could tell
   <br/>
   And when love stole my vision far over the brine
   <br/>
   I drank your success in a goblet of wine
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Three times have I crossed to the __
   <br/>
   We came down the breast of the silvery bay
   <br/>
   And my crew are the bravest ever handled __
   <br/>
   I'm not by the tempest, they laugh at its roar
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   No drink will I take for to lighten my heart
   <br/>
   But the wildest adventures I'll take for my heart
   <br/>
   No women on earth will I have for my bride
   <br/>
   'Til I cross the wild Atlantic and be your side
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Ah me, I must mourn my true love evermore
   <br/>
   Though coldly forsaken, it's you adore
   <br/>
   And if you would return then I'd make you my bride
   <br/>
   Or I'll cross the wild Atlantic to be by your side
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
