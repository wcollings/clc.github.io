  <p align="center">
   The violets were scenting the woods, Maggie
   <br/>
   Displaying their charms to the breeze
   <br/>
   When I first said I loved only you, Maggie
   <br/>
   And you said you loved only me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The chestnut blooms gleamed through the glades, Maggie
   <br/>
   A robin sang aloud from the tree
   <br/>
   When I first said I loved only you, Maggie
   <br/>
   And you said you loved only me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   A golden row of daffodils shone, Maggie
   <br/>
   And danced with the leaves on the breeze
   <br/>
   When I first said I loved only you, Maggie
   <br/>
   And you said you loved only me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The birds in the trees sang a song, Maggie
   <br/>
   Of happy a trance for us to be
   <br/>
   When I first said I loved only you, Maggie
   <br/>
   And you said you loved only me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Our dreams, they have never come true, Maggie
   <br/>
   Our hopes, they never were to be
   <br/>
   When I first said I loved only you, Maggie
   <br/>
   And you said you loved only me
  </p>
