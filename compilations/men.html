  <p align="center">
   Leave the land behind, laddie, there's better days to find
   <br/>
   The companies have the money and they'll soon teach you the skill
   <br/>
   There's green fields far away, lad, at the forties and the brae
   <br/>
   Be a mudman or a roustabout, ye'll soon learn how to drill
   <br/>
   But who will tend my sheep when I'm far o'er the deep?
   <br/>
   On the Neptune or the Seaquest when the snows come to the hill
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Leave the fishin trade, lad, there's money tae be made
   <br/>
   The handline and the Shetland yawl are from a bygone day
   <br/>
   Come tae Aberdeen, lad, see sights ye've never seen
   <br/>
   Be a welder on the pipeline or a fitter at Nigg Bay
   <br/>
   But when the work is o'er and my boat rots on the shore
   <br/>
   How will I feed my family when the companies move away?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There's harbors to be built, lad, an rigs to tow an tilt
   <br/>
   That sit upon the ocean bed like pylons in the sea
   <br/>
   There's pipelines to be laid an a hundred different trades
   <br/>
   That'll give a decent livin wage to the likes o' you and me
   <br/>
   I ken ye're men o' worth, ye're the best men in the north
   <br/>
   Not men of greed, but men who need the work that's come yer way
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   From Flutta tae Kishorn a new industry is born
   <br/>
   Now Peterhead and Cromarty will never be the same
  </p>
