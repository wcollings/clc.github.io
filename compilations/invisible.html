  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Didn't see me, you didn't see me at all
   <br/>
   Couldn't hear me, so you couldn't have heard me fall
   <br/>
   And you never knew though I did everything I could do
   <br/>
   'Cause I, I was invisible to you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Lost my shadow, crossed my shadow with yours
   <br/>
   Passed a mirror, got no reflection there anymore
   <br/>
   Since you walked right through, now I can't even seem to be blue
   <br/>
   'Cause I, I was invisible to you
   <br/>
   Oh I, I was invisible to you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Two in the morning
   <br/>
   Staring at these pictures on my wall
   <br/>
   It's funny how the pictures never call
   <br/>
   And you never knew
   <br/>
   Though I did everything I could do
   <br/>
   'Cause I, I was invisible to you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Didn't see me, you didn't see me at all
   <br/>
   Couldn't hear me, so you couldn't have heard me fall
   <br/>
   And you never knew though I did everything I could do
   <br/>
   'Cause I, I was invisible to you
   <br/>
   Oh I, I was invisible to you...
  </p>
