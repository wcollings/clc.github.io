  <p align="center">
   The wee birds were lining the bleak autumn branches
   <br/>
   Preparing to fly to a far, sunny shore
   <br/>
   When the Tinkers made camp at a bend in the river
   <br/>
   Coming back from the horse fair in Ballinasloe
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Now the harvest being over, the farmer came walking
   <br/>
   All along the Foyle River that borders his land
   <br/>
   And it was there he first saw her 'twixt firelight and water
   <br/>
   The Tinkerman's daughter, the red-headed Anne
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Next morning he rose from a night without resting
   <br/>
   He went straight tae her father and he made his case known
   <br/>
   And in a pub in Listowel they worked out a bargain
   <br/>
   For the Tinker, a pony; for the daughter, a home
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Where the trees cast their shadows along the Foyle River
   <br/>
   The Tinker and the farmer inspected the land
   <br/>
   And the white, gallant wild pony was the price they agreed on
   <br/>
   For the Tinkerman's daughter, the red-headed Anne
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The wedding soon over, the Tinkers departed
   <br/>
   And they were eager tae travel on south down the road
   <br/>
   But the crunch of the iron-shod wheels upon gravel
   <br/>
   Was as bitter to her as the way she'd been sold
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But she tried hard to please him, she did all his bidding
   <br/>
   She slept in his bed and she worked on his land
   <br/>
   But the walls of that cabin pressed tighter and tighter
   <br/>
   On the Tinkerman's daughter, the red-headed Anne
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   For as white as the hands of the priest or the hangman
   <br/>
   The snow spread its blanket the next Christmas 'round
   <br/>
   And the Tinkerman's daughter slipped out from his bedside
   <br/>
   Turned her back on the land and her face to the town
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And it's said someone saw her at dusk that same evening
   <br/>
   She was making her way out o'er Laoiracrumpan
   <br/>
   Aye, and that was the last time the settlefolk saw her
   <br/>
   The Tinkerman's daughter, the red-headed Anne
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Where the North Kerry hills cut the Foyle near Listowel
   <br/>
   At a farm on its banks lives a bitter old man
   <br/>
   And he swears by the shotgun he keeps at his bedside
   <br/>
   That he'll kill any Tinker that camps on his land
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Yet whenever he hears iron-shod wheels crunch on gravel
   <br/>
   Or a horse in the shafts of a bright caravan
   <br/>
   Then his day's work's tormented and his night's sleep's demented
   <br/>
   By the Tinkerman's daughter, the red-headed Anne
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
 </body>
