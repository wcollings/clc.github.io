<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua"><b><u>Lyrics</u>:</b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
The wee birds were lining the bleak autumn branches<br>
Preparing to fly to a far, sunny shore<br>
When the Tinkers made camp at a bend in the river<br>
Coming back from the horse fair in Ballinasloe</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
Now the harvest being over, the farmer came walking<br>
All along the Foyle River that borders his land<br>
And it was there he first saw her 'twixt firelight and water<br>
The Tinkerman's daughter, the red-headed Anne</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
Next morning he rose from a night without resting<br>
He went straight tae her father and he made his case known<br>
And in a pub in Listowel they worked out a bargain<br>
For the Tinker, a pony; for the daughter, a home</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
Where the trees cast their shadows along the Foyle River<br>
The Tinker and the farmer inspected the land<br>
And the white, gallant wild pony was the price they agreed on<br>
For the Tinkerman's daughter, the red-headed Anne</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
The wedding soon over, the Tinkers departed<br>
And they were eager tae travel on south down the road<br>
But the crunch of the iron-shod wheels upon gravel<br>
Was as bitter to her as the way she'd been sold</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
But she tried hard to please him, she did all his bidding<br>
She slept in his bed and she worked on his land<br>
But the walls of that cabin pressed tighter and tighter<br>
On the Tinkerman's daughter, the red-headed Anne</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
For as white as the hands of the priest or the hangman<br>
The snow spread its blanket the next Christmas 'round<br>
And the Tinkerman's daughter slipped out from his bedside<br>
Turned her back on the land and her face to the town</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
And it's said someone saw her at dusk that same evening<br>
She was making her way out o'er Laoiracrumpan<br>
Aye, and that was the last time the settlefolk saw her<br>
The Tinkerman's daughter, the red-headed Anne</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
Where the North Kerry hills cut the Foyle near Listowel<br>
At a farm on its banks lives a bitter old man<br>
And he swears by the shotgun he keeps at his bedside<br>
That he'll kill any Tinker that camps on his land</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
Yet whenever he hears iron-shod wheels crunch on gravel<br>
Or a horse in the shafts of a bright caravan<br>
Then his day's work's tormented and his night's sleep's demented<br>
By the Tinkerman's daughter, the red-headed Anne</font></p></body>
