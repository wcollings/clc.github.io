  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh the town, it climbs the mountain and looks upon the sea
   <br/>
   At sleeping time or waking, 'tis there I'd long to be
   <br/>
   To walk again that kindly street, the place where life began
   <br/>
   And the Boys of Barr na Sráide went hunting for the wren
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   With cudgels stout they roamed about to hunt the dreólín
   <br/>
   We searched for birds in every furze from Litir to Dooneen
   <br/>
   We sang for joy beneath the sky, life held no print nor plan
   <br/>
   And the Boys of Barr na Sráide went hunting for the wren
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And when the hills were bleeding and the rifles were aflame
   <br/>
   To the rebel homes of Kerry the Saxon stranger came
   <br/>
   But the men who dared the Auxies and to beat the Black-and-Tan
   <br/>
   The Boys of Barr na Sráide who hunted for the wren
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And here's a toast to them tonight, the lads who laughed with me
   <br/>
   By the groves of Carham river or the slope of Bean 'a Tí
   <br/>
   John Daly and Batt Andy and the Sheehans, Con and Dan
   <br/>
   And the Boys of Barr na Sráide who hunted for the wren
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And now they toil on foreign soil, for they have gone their way
   <br/>
   Deep in the heart of London town or over in Broadway
   <br/>
   And I am left to sing their deeds and praise them while I can
   <br/>
   Those Boys of Barr na Sráide who hunted for the wren
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And when the wheel of life runs down and peace comes over me
   <br/>
   Oh lay me down in that old town between the hills and sea
   <br/>
   I'll take my sleep in those green fields, the place my life began
   <br/>
   Where those Boys of Barr na Sráide went hunting for the wren
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
