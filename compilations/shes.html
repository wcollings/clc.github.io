  <p align="center">
   She's gone, she's gone
   <br/>
   She's gone, she's gone
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And though you knew she was on her way
   <br/>
   You never thought you could feel the way you feel today
   <br/>
   She's gone
   <br/>
   She's gone
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She had reasons of her own, I know
   <br/>
   You can't breathe when the sky's so low
   <br/>
   She had visions in her eyes
   <br/>
   Solace for orphans in her smile
   <br/>
   She's gone
   <br/>
   She's gone
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There's a painter somewhere
   <br/>
   Searching for the color of her hair
   <br/>
   There'll be no more traces on the sand
   <br/>
   And soon there'll be blue birds trapped in your hands
   <br/>
   'Cause she's gone, she's gone
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Can't you see torches on the shore?
   <br/>
   Shipwreckers of time ask for more
   <br/>
   And there's a little boy in midair
   <br/>
   With a bleeding memory, who cares?
   <br/>
   She's gone
   <br/>
   She's gone
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   What did you ask when came your turn?
   <br/>
   Didn't they tell you how long you might have to run?
   <br/>
   And you know no boat would let you in
   <br/>
   With all the shadows and ghosts you're carrying
   <br/>
   She's gone, she's gone
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She had reasons of her own I know
   <br/>
   You can't breathe when the sky's so low
   <br/>
   She had visions in her eyes
   <br/>
   Solace for orphans in her smile
   <br/>
   And she's gone, she's gone
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And I know where she flies
   <br/>
   And I know where she lives
   <br/>
   A little boy on her side
   <br/>
   A man's sharing her way
   <br/>
   Don't try to hide
   <br/>
   There are sorrows deep in your eyes
   <br/>
   There's a empty town
   <br/>
   They'll be blinds on their own
   <br/>
   They'll be Sundays throughout the years
   <br/>
   She's gone, she's gone
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
