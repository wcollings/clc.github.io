  </p>
  <p align="center">
   They say the skies of Lebanon are burning
   <br/>
   Those mighty cedars bleeding in the heat
   <br/>
   They're showing pictures on the television
   <br/>
   Women and children dying in the street
   <br/>
   And we're still at it in our own place
   <br/>
   Still trying to reach the future through the past
   <br/>
   Still trying to carve tomorrow from a tombstone
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But hey, don't listen to me
   <br/>
   'Cause this wasn't meant to be no sad song
   <br/>
   We've had too much of that before
   <br/>
   Right now I only want to be here with you
   <br/>
   'Til the morning dew comes falling
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I want to take you to the island
   <br/>
   And trace your footprints in the sand
   <br/>
   And in the evening when the sun goes down
   <br/>
   We'll make love to the sound of the ocean
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   They're raising banners over by the markets
   <br/>
   Whitewashing slogans on the shipyard wall
   <br/>
   Witchdoctors praying for a mighty showdown
   <br/>
   No way our holy flag is gonna fall
   <br/>
   Up here we sacrifice our children
   <br/>
   To feed the worn-out dreams of yesterday
   <br/>
   And teach them dying can lead them into glory
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But hey, don't listen to me
   <br/>
   'Cause this wasn't meant to be no sad song
   <br/>
   I've sung too much of that before
   <br/>
   Right now I only want to be here with you
   <br/>
   'Til the morning dew comes falling
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I want to take you to the island
   <br/>
   And trace your footprints in the sand
   <br/>
   And in the evening when there's no one around
   <br/>
   We'll make love to the sound of the ocean
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Now I know us plain folks don't see all the story
   <br/>
   And I know this peace and love is just copping out
   <br/>
   And I guess these young boys dying in the ditches
   <br/>
   Is just what being free is all about
   <br/>
   And how this twisted wreckage down on main street
   <br/>
   Will bring us all together in the end
   <br/>
   Now we go marching down the road to freedom
   <br/>
   Freedom
  </p>
