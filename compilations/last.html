  </p>
  <p align="center">
   A've aye worked on farms an frae the start
   <br/>
   The muckle horses won my heart
   <br/>
   Wi big broad backs they proudly stand
   <br/>
   The uncrowned kings o' a' the land
   <br/>
   And yet for a' their power and strength
   <br/>
   They're as gentle as a summer's wind
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus (after each verse)
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   So steady, boys, walk on
   <br/>
   Oor work is nearly done
   <br/>
   Nor more we'll till or plough the fields
   <br/>
   The horses' day is gone
   <br/>
   An' this will be our last trip home
   <br/>
   So steady, boys, walk on
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Now you'll hear men sing their songs of praise
   <br/>
   Of Arab stallions in a race
   <br/>
   Or hunters that fly wi' the hounds
   <br/>
   Tae chase the fox and run him down
   <br/>
   But none o' them compare, I vow
   <br/>
   Tae a workin' pair that pulls a plough
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And a' the years I've plied my trade
   <br/>
   And a' the fields we've ploughed and laid
   <br/>
   I never thought I'd see the time
   <br/>
   When a Clydesdale's work wid ever end
   <br/>
   But progress runs its driven course
   <br/>
   And tractors hae replaced the horse
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   As we head back, oor friends have lined
   <br/>
   The road tae be there one last time
   <br/>
   For nane of them would want tae miss
   <br/>
   The chance tae see us pass like this
   <br/>
   They'll say they saw in years tae come
   <br/>
   The muckle horses' last trip home
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
