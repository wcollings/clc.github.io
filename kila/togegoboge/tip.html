  <p align="center">
   So tip toe through tireless peace
   <br/>
   Come and go, leave your toys and sweets
   <br/>
   If I had a place you could visit me
   <br/>
   Read fairy tales, play hide and go seek
   <br/>
   Cliff faces are far too steep
   <br/>
   Even though we try to smile through our teeth
   <br/>
   And this surface is not so deep
   <br/>
   Although we have our secrets to keep
   <br/>
   And tightropes are seldom too weak
   <br/>
   Say, I've lost my shoes or I have cold feet
   <br/>
   And say, stranger, how did we meet?
   <br/>
   Who will hear us when we start to speak?
   <br/>
   While our shadows are still out on the street
   <br/>
   My skin still as white as a sheet
   <br/>
   And our time is short and fleet
   <br/>
   Empty pockets, trick or treat
   <br/>
   We all need food to eat
   <br/>
   Friend or foe, we all go to sleep
   <br/>
   And life away from home is far from cheap
   <br/>
   So look long now before you leap
   <br/>
   And hey, soldier, please have a seat
   <br/>
   You're only alive while you're on parked feet
   <br/>
   There will always be wolves among the sheep
   <br/>
   But what's left of the earth will be plowed by the meek
   <br/>
   Plowed by the meek, by the meek
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So tip toe through tireless peace
   <br/>
   Come and go, leave your toys and sweets
   <br/>
   When I have a place come to visit me
   <br/>
   Read fairy tales, play hide and go seek
   <br/>
   And go seek...
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
