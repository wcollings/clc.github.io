     Lyrics

   </b>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You crafted and caressed her with a careful hand
   <br/>
   But the lady didn't understand
   <br/>
   And you riveted and plated her 'til morning
   <br/>
   But with a coil or a careless spark
   <br/>
   Or a tumble in the dark
   <br/>
   She'll leave her mark upon you without warning
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   You can float a boat of steel upon the ocean
   <br/>
   You can fix it up with nuts and bolts and toil
   <br/>
   But you can't weld a body when it's broken, no
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, the lady she's as fair as Desdemona
   <br/>
   She swallowed you up just like Jonah
   <br/>
   And there the air inside her belly ailed you
   <br/>
   And no one saw you fall
   <br/>
   And they did not hear your call
   <br/>
   And your breath it faltered just before it failed you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   On a cruiser that was fitted by your father
   <br/>
   You anchored in San Carlos harbor
   <br/>
   But the lady at the helm, she was not for turning
   <br/>
   And in your bell bottoms blue
   <br/>
   In April eighty-two
   <br/>
   You bid adieu and watched all you knew burning
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You can float a boat of steel upon the ocean
   <br/>
   You can fix it up with nuts and bolts and toil
   <br/>
   But you can't weld a body when it's broken
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
 </body>
