  <p align="center">
   There was a lady in the north
   <br/>
   You scarce would find her marrow
   <br/>
   She was courted by nine gentlemen
   <br/>
   And a plooboy lad fae Yarrow
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, nine sat drinking at the wine
   <br/>
   As oft they'd done afore O
   <br/>
   And they made a vow amang themselves
   <br/>
   Tae fight for her on Yarrow
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And so he's come ower yon high, high hill
   <br/>
   And doon by the den sae narrow
   <br/>
   And there he spied nine armed men
   <br/>
   Come tae fight wi' him on Yarrow
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He says, "There's nine o' you and but one o' me
   <br/>
   It's an unequal marrow"
   <br/>
   But I'll fight ye a' noo one by one
   <br/>
   On the Dowie Dens o' Yarrow
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So it's three he slew and three withdrew
   <br/>
   An' three he wounded sairly
   <br/>
   'Til her brother, he came in beyond
   <br/>
   And he wounded him maist foully
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Gae hame, gae hame, ye fause young man
   <br/>
   And bring yer sister sorrow
   <br/>
   For her ain true love lies pale and wan
   <br/>
   On the Dowie Dens o' Yarrow
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Oh mither, I hae dreamed a dream
   <br/>
   A dream o' doul and sorrow
   <br/>
   I dreamed I was pu'ing the heathery bells
   <br/>
   On the Dowie Dens o' Yarrow"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Oh daughter dear, I ken yer dream
   <br/>
   And I doobt it will bring sorrow
   <br/>
   For yer ain true love lies pale and wan
   <br/>
   On the Dowie Dens o' Yarrow"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   An' so she's run ower yon high, high hill
   <br/>
   An' doon by the den sae narrow
   <br/>
   And it's there she spied her dear lover John
   <br/>
   Lyin' pale and deid on Yarrow
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And so she's washed his face an' she's kaimed his hair
   <br/>
   As aft she'd done afore O
   <br/>
   And she's wrapped it 'roond her middle sae sma'
   <br/>
   And she's carried him hame tae Yarrow
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Oh haud yer tongue, my daughter dear
   <br/>
   What need for a' this sorrow?
   <br/>
   I'll wed ye tae a far better man
   <br/>
   Than the one who's slain on Yarrow"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Oh faither, ye hae seven sons
   <br/>
   And ye may wed them a' the morrow
   <br/>
   But the fairest floo'er amang them a'
   <br/>
   Was the plooboy lad fae Yarrow
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Oh mother, mother mak my bed
   <br/>
   And mak it saft and narrow
   <br/>
   For my love died for me this day
   <br/>
   And I'll die for him tomorrow"
  </p>
