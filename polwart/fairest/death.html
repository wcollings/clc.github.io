  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Queen Jane lay in labor full six days or more
   <br/>
   While the women grew weary and the midwives gave o'er
   <br/>
   And they sent for King Henry to come with great speed
   <br/>
   To be with Queen Jane in her hour of need
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   King Henry came to her and he sat by her bedside
   <br/>
   Saying, "What ails thee, my Jeannie? What ails thee, my bride?"
   <br/>
   "Oh Henry, oh Henry, do this one thing for me
   <br/>
   Rip open my right side and find my baby"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Oh Jeannie, oh Jeannie, that never will do
   <br/>
   It would lease thy sweet life and thy young baby, too"
   <br/>
   Well, she wept and she wailed 'til she fell into a swoon
   <br/>
   And her right side was opened and her baby was found
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, that baby was christened the very next day
   <br/>
   While his poor dead mother a-mouldering lay
   <br/>
   And six men went before her and four more travelled on
   <br/>
   While loyal King Henry stood mourning alone
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He wept and he wailed until he was sore
   <br/>
   Saying, "The flower of all England shall flourish no more"
   <br/>
   He sat by the river with his head in his hands
   <br/>
   Saying, "My merry England is a sorrowful land"
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
