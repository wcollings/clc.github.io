  <p align="center">
   There lived a wife at Usher's Well
   <br/>
   And a wealthy wife was she
   <br/>
   She had three stout and stalwart sons
   <br/>
   And she sent them o'er the sea
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, they hadna been a month frae her
   <br/>
   Not one month and a day
   <br/>
   When cauld, cauld death come o'er the land
   <br/>
   And he stole those boys away
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She said, "I wish the wind would never mair blaw
   <br/>
   Nor fish swim in the flood
   <br/>
   'Til my three boys come hame tae me
   <br/>
   In earthly flesh and blood
   <br/>
   In earthly flesh and blood"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, it fell aboot the Martinmas time
   <br/>
   When the nichts are lang and mirk
   <br/>
   The carlin wife's three boys come hame
   <br/>
   And their hats were o' the birk
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   That neither grew in any wood
   <br/>
   Nor down by any wall
   <br/>
   But at the gates o' paradise
   <br/>
   Aye, the birken tree grew tall
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, she has laid the table braid
   <br/>
   Wi' bread and blood-red wine
   <br/>
   "Come eat and drink, my bonnie boys
   <br/>
   Come eat and drink o' mine"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Oh mither, bread we cannae eat
   <br/>
   Nor can we drink the wine
   <br/>
   For cauld, cauld death is lord of all
   <br/>
   And to him we must resign
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   For the green, green grass is at oor heads
   <br/>
   And the clay is at oor feet
   <br/>
   And how your tears come tumbling down
   <br/>
   To wet the winding sheet
   <br/>
   To wet the winding sheet"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, she has made the bed full braid
   <br/>
   She's made it lang and deep
   <br/>
   She's laid it all wi' golden thread
   <br/>
   And she's lulled those boys tae sleep
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, the cock, he hadna crowed but once
   <br/>
   Tae welcome in the day
   <br/>
   When the eldest tae the youngest says
   <br/>
   "Brother, we must away
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   For the cock does craw, the day does daw
   <br/>
   And the chunnerin worm does chide
   <br/>
   And if we're missed out o' oor place
   <br/>
   Then a sair pain we maun bide
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   For the green, green grass is at oor heads
   <br/>
   And the clay is at oor feet
   <br/>
   And how your tears come tumbling down
   <br/>
   To wet the winding sheet
   <br/>
   To wet the winding sheet"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She said, "I wish the wind will never blaw
   <br/>
   Nor fish swim in the flood
   <br/>
   'Til my three boys come hame to me
   <br/>
   In earthly flesh and blood
   <br/>
   In earthly flesh and blood"
  </p>
