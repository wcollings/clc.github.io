  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When your time on the mountain is over
   <br/>
   And you fall to the earth like a leaf
   <br/>
   It won't be enough these days to say sorry
   <br/>
   Sorry won't pay for this grief
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   You may lay down your guilt on the altar
   <br/>
   Nail your remorse to the cross
   <br/>
   But it's not enough these days to say sorry
   <br/>
   Sorry won't pay for this loss
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And if the blood on your hands turns to water
   <br/>
   And the night in your soul turns to day
   <br/>
   It won't be enough this time to say sorry
   <br/>
   Sorry won't wash it all away
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When you're through with the spells you've been spinning
   <br/>
   And your hopes and your dreams have all died
   <br/>
   It won't be enough these days to say sorry
   <br/>
   Sorry won't turn back the tide
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You may lay down your guilt on the altar
   <br/>
   Nail your remorse to the cross
   <br/>
   It's not enough these days to say sorry
   <br/>
   No, sorry won't pay for this loss
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And if you should desist from deceiving
   <br/>
   And if you should confess to the crime
   <br/>
   It won't be enough these days to say sorry
   <br/>
   No, no, sorry won't save you this time
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You may lay down your guilt on the altar
   <br/>
   Nail your remorse to the cross
   <br/>
   But it's not enough these days to say sorry
   <br/>
   No, no, sorry won't pay for this loss
   <br/>
   (2x)
