   </b>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Ten thousand years of big ideas
   <br/>
   Distilled into a billion fears
   <br/>
   A grand design, a shiny rocket
   <br/>
   A bullet in a bully's pocket
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So mesmerized by particles
   <br/>
   We disregard the articles
   <br/>
   The ones we wrote to keep the peace
   <br/>
   Sullied now in blood and greed and grease
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Is this the best that we can do?
   <br/>
   Oh I can think of better things, can't you?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   With the devil's pitchfork in our hands
   <br/>
   We turn the fields of foreign lands
   <br/>
   We mine the Gulf, we dig it deeper
   <br/>
   We free the serpent from its keeper
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Yet these are the hands that fix the bones
   <br/>
   The ones that build with sticks and stones
   <br/>
   These are the hands that plant the tree
   <br/>
   The ones that pull the newborn baby free
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Is this the best that we can do?
   <br/>
   Oh I can think of better things, can't you?
   <br/>
   Oh I can think of better things
   <br/>
   That hands can make and hearts can sing
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   For now we deal with those for whom
   <br/>
   A life is but a carnal tomb
   <br/>
   In which the darkness holds no power
   <br/>
   Neither does the final hour
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We may lament the deadly art
   <br/>
   Of tiny atoms torn apart
   <br/>
   Visions that we can't return
   <br/>
   And future fires in which we fear we'll burn
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But this is the art of those before
   <br/>
   Who found a cure within the core
   <br/>
   The noble mind behind the ray
   <br/>
   That eased our earthly cares away
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Is this the best that we can do?
   <br/>
   Oh I can think of better things, can't you?
   <br/>
   Oh I can think of better things
   <br/>
   That hands can make and hearts can sing
   <br/>
   And hearts can sing
  </p>
