  </p>
  <p align="center">
   A broken spell
   <br/>
   A wishing well whose waters are dry
   <br/>
   A warning bell
   <br/>
   A yellow ribbon too torn to fly
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Stone turns to dust
   <br/>
   Rusting metal, muscle to bone
   <br/>
   We're looking for a locust wind
   <br/>
   To carry us home
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   We believed in those words that you said
   <br/>
   You took a black heart and you painted it red
   <br/>
   We deceived ourselves every night
   <br/>
   As you took a black heart and you painted it white
   <br/>
   You painted it white
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   A blazing sky
   <br/>
   A brazen lie you barely concealed
   <br/>
   A promise made
   <br/>
   Betrayed upon a sorrowful field
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Nobody learns
   <br/>
   Seems like everybody turns to the screen
   <br/>
   To watch it pass
   <br/>
   But not to ask, "What does it mean?"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Now you're falling
   <br/>
   You're falling
   <br/>
   And you're falling
   <br/>
   And you're falling
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So here we are
   <br/>
   We're not so far from where we could be
   <br/>
   You've got a gun
   <br/>
   The one you say will keep us all free
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So free that you
   <br/>
   Can bomb a blue horizon to black
   <br/>
   Then steal away the day
   <br/>
   And never, never give it back
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Now you're falling
   <br/>
   You're falling
   <br/>
   And you're falling...
  </p>
