     Lyrics

    :
   </b>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I was born with a tongue that cannot lie
   <br/>
   And how it grieves me
   <br/>
   Each fleeting thought behind my eye
   <br/>
   Just up and leaves me
   <br/>
   Into the wild like a bastard child
   <br/>
   Born under a briar
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh to be, oh to be
   <br/>
   Oh to be a liar
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I've been courted by saints and by sinners
   <br/>
   Who know all the things that a tongue can tell
   <br/>
   Whose discrete invitations for sweet revelations
   <br/>
   Were such an enticement to sell
   <br/>
   But the street price of secrets seduced and reduced me
   <br/>
   To trading without any care
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Oh to be, oh to be
   <br/>
   Oh to be a liar
   <br/>
   Oh to be, oh to be
   <br/>
   Oh to be a liar
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And so in conscience I chose to avoid those
   <br/>
   Consumed by ambitions of earthly dominion
   <br/>
   But even this act, the omission of fact
   <br/>
   Just delighted the lords of opinion
   <br/>
   And in retreat from it all, I did fall for a man
   <br/>
   Who swore that my words were a blessing
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But for each of the beautiful daughters we bore
   <br/>
   I betrayed all the joy in my heart
   <br/>
   And each harmless invention or childlike convention
   <br/>
   I brutally shattered apart
   <br/>
   Some say love is saying the way that it is
   <br/>
   But believe me it just isn't so
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   For the joy of surprises and the tooth-fairy wonder
   <br/>
   And Halloween guises were all torn asunder
   <br/>
   And the lovely mistruths that I so longed to utter
   <br/>
   Dissolved in the blink of a tear just like butter
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   For a tongue that can't lie
   <br/>
   Shall cause the meek to cry
   <br/>
   Cruel words to cut them through
   <br/>
   And a tongue that can't lie
   <br/>
   Shall cause the righteous few
   <br/>
   To silence all that is true
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Now I wander these earthly lands from pole to pole
   <br/>
   And from shore to lonely shore
   <br/>
   Seeking concealment in corners, but somehow the world
   <br/>
   Still descends on my door
   <br/>
   Afflicted, addicted I pray for a potion
   <br/>
   To take all these visions away
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh to be, oh to be
   <br/>
   Oh to be a liar
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So tear out this tongue and stitch up these barbarous eyes
   <br/>
   With which I see
   <br/>
   And grant me the right to spare you
   <br/>
   The cold callous cut of reality
   <br/>
   Won't you take all this knowing
   <br/>
   And leave me with nothing, no, nothing at all?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Let me speak what I will
   <br/>
   And reserve all the rest
   <br/>
   And I'll walk through the world
   <br/>
   Neither blighted nor blessed
   <br/>
   For my sole modest wish now before my demise
   <br/>
   Is to savor the sweetness and the kindness of lies
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   For a tongue that can't lie
   <br/>
   Shall cause the meek to cry
   <br/>
   Cruel words to cut them through
   <br/>
   And a tongue that can't lie
   <br/>
   Shall cause the righteous few
   <br/>
   To silence all that is true
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
