  <p align="center">
   Sometimes you just get caught where the smoke blows
   <br/>
   And you just have to breathe it in until it all goes
   <br/>
   Don't you know it'll all be gone when you're gone?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Sometimes a thing looks shit on the inside
   <br/>
   And from farther away it's the ebb and the flow of the tide
   <br/>
   Don't you know it'll all be gone when you're gone?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   A small mind with a big notion
   <br/>
   Brought down to earth by the size of the ocean wide
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Sometimes you just can't see what's bigger
   <br/>
   You're caught in the frame, just a tiny figure
   <br/>
   Don't you know it'll all be gone when you're gone?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Sometimes the thing you think you have your eyes on
   <br/>
   Just fades out of view on the far horizon
   <br/>
   Don't you know it'll all be gone when you're gone?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   A small mind with a big lie
   <br/>
   Brought down to earth by the size of the sky
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   All the men with enormous heads and tiny hearts
   <br/>
   In the end they're only playing incidental parts
   <br/>
   Don't you know it'll all be gone when you're gone?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   A small mind with a big notion
   <br/>
   Brought down to earth by the ocean
   <br/>
   And a small mind with a big lie
   <br/>
   Brought down to earth by the size of the sky
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Sometimes you just get caught where the smoke blows...
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
