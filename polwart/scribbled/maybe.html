   I've kind of got used to being cold
   <br/>
   I know I was warm one day a long, long time ago
   <br/>
   Maybe there's a road that's not this hard
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I'd rather not way why I couldn't stay home
   <br/>
   But now I get paid never to be alone
   <br/>
   Maybe there's a road that's not this hard
   <br/>
   Maybe there's a road that's not this hard
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The trucks roll by here every night
   <br/>
   I know how to come on in a headlight
   <br/>
   Maybe there's a road that's not this hard
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The signs are in a language I don't understand
   <br/>
   But I'm not going anywhere anyway, so I don't give a damn
   <br/>
   Maybe there's a road that's not this hard
   <br/>
   Maybe there's a road that's not this hard
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I think I caught his eye about four a.m.
   <br/>
   I thought he looked kinder than the other men
   <br/>
   Maybe there's a road that's not this hard
   <br/>
   Maybe there's a road that's not this hard
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Now somewhere someone's saying I was in the wrong
   <br/>
   And that I never should have traveled where I don't belong
   <br/>
   Maybe there's a road that's not this hard
   <br/>
   Maybe there's a road that's not this hard
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I don't know where I am, but I know I'm gonna stay
   <br/>
   'Cause if you just stand still you can never lose your way
   <br/>
   Maybe there's a road that's not this hard
   <br/>
   Maybe there's a road that's not this hard
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Show me a road that's not this hard
   <br/>
   Show me a road that's not this hard
  </p>

  </cleaned>
