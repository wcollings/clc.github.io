  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You ceased to mow the lawn ten years ago
   <br/>
   You just wanted to see how your garden would grow
   <br/>
   You abandoned the pruning shears and welcomed each weed
   <br/>
   You permitted the soil to select its own seed
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But it would be unfair to assume you don't care
   <br/>
   For you pay great attention to all that goes there
   <br/>
   But you simply abstain from a plan or design
   <br/>
   You just let it all hang out and take its own time
   <br/>
   You just let it all hang out and take its own time
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And you follow a thread in a book that you've read
   <br/>
   Or in something that someone you heard somewhere said
   <br/>
   You say, "It's all connected, it's all intertwined
   <br/>
   If you let it all hang out and take its own time
   <br/>
   If you let it all hang out and take its own time"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, you don't move too fast, you make it all last
   <br/>
   You encounter each moment before it is past
   <br/>
   And you say, "Walking slow in this world is no crime"
   <br/>
   You just let it all hang out and take its own time...
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
