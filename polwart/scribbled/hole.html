  <p align="center">
   I made everything come undone
   <br/>
   I made everything fall apart
   <br/>
   I quit running to the finishing line
   <br/>
   And I went back to the start
   <br/>
   I found a great, big hole in the middle of my life
   <br/>
   Shaped just like my heart, just like my heart
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I lost sight of what was under my feet
   <br/>
   'Cause I always had to be on top
   <br/>
   And I was so drunk on love
   <br/>
   That I didn't taste a single drop
   <br/>
   And I used to make everything run on time
   <br/>
   'Til I made the whole world stop, I made it stop
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Now I'm watching the world move in slow motion
   <br/>
   Now I'm finding it easy to breathe
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   For too long I've been trying to walk
   <br/>
   In high heels through a river of mud
   <br/>
   For too long I've been trying to talk
   <br/>
   Over the sound of rushing blood
   <br/>
   Where truth is a story scribbled in chalk
   <br/>
   Just an hour before the flood, before the flood
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Now I'm watching the world move in slow motion
   <br/>
   Now I'm finding it easy to breathe
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I made everything come undone
   <br/>
   I made everything fall apart
   <br/>
   I quit running to the finishing line
   <br/>
   And I went back to the start
   <br/>
   I found a great, big hole in the middle of my life
   <br/>
   Shaped just like my heart, just like my heart
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Just like my heart...
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
