  </p>
  <p align="center">
   All of these moments cling to each other
   <br/>
   Just like a small boy clutches his mother
   <br/>
   Maybe one day they'll go their own way
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I keep linking the daisies into chains
   <br/>
   I keep blinking to see if it all looks the same
   <br/>
   Maybe one day they'll go their own way
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Clouds form and disperse in the summer sky
   <br/>
   Clouds form and disperse, and I don't know why
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And nothing moves in a straight line, all these roads are not Roman
   <br/>
   And the ruler rods of time are not fixed or frozen
   <br/>
   Maybe one day they'll go their own way
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I keep linking the daisies into chains
   <br/>
   I keep blinking to see if it all looks the same
   <br/>
   Maybe one day they'll go their own way
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   All of these moments cling to each other
   <br/>
   Just like a small boy clutches his mother
   <br/>
   Maybe one day they'll go their own way
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I don't know why
   <br/>
   I don't know why
   <br/>
   I don't know why
  </p>
