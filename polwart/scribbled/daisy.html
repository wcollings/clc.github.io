   Hey Daisy darling, don't spread your arms so wide
   <br/>
   Why don't you keep a little something inside?
   <br/>
   I know you think that hands are made for pulling us through
   <br/>
   But there are people in this world who don't think like you do
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Hey Daisy darling, don't give them all you can
   <br/>
   Why don't you keep a few more cards in you hand?
   <br/>
   I know you'll only say a thing you believe to be true
   <br/>
   But there are people in this world who don't think like you do
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   They don't think like you do
   <br/>
   And some don't think at all
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Hey Daisy darling, don't take it all as read
   <br/>
   Why don't you ask a few more questions instead?
   <br/>
   I know you think that everyone should be paid what they're due
   <br/>
   But there are people in this world who don't think like you do
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   They don't think like you do
   <br/>
   And some don't think at all
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Hey Daisy darling, don't spread your arms so wide
   <br/>
   Why don't you keep a little something inside?
   <br/>
   I know you think that hands are made for pulling us through
   <br/>
   But there are people in this world who don't think like you do
  </p>

   And I know you'll only say a thing you believe to be true

   But there are people in this world who don't think like you do
   <br/>
