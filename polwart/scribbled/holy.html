  <p align="center">
   Holy Moses asleep in his basket
   <br/>
   Encountered a question, he couldn't ask it
   <br/>
   And nor could he answer in baby sighs and baby cries
   <br/>
   At least he heard no doubt, at least he heard no lies
   <br/>
   Holy Moses
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Holy Moses afloat on the river
   <br/>
   Swaddled in big ideals, surrounded in water
   <br/>
   Too big for his tiny hands and tiny heart
   <br/>
   But in his eyes the size of all he would later part
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Somebody told him, "Here's a thing you cannot do"
   <br/>
   He did it anyway just to prove it was not true
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Holy Moses, Holy Moses
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Holy Moses, is it any wonder
   <br/>
   That somebody raised upon secrets and undertows
   <br/>
   Would know all the ways to reveal what is hidden
   <br/>
   And would be the one who conveys all that's forbidden?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And yet somebody told him, "Here's a thing you cannot do"
   <br/>
   He did it anyway just to prove it was not true
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Holy Moses, Holy Moses
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Somebody told him, "Here's a thing you cannot do"
   <br/>
   He did it anyway just to prove it was not true
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Holy Moses...
  </p>
