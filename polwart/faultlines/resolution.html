   Resolution road
   <br/>
   Who's your friend and who's your foe?
   <br/>
   And how do tell the one from the other?
   <br/>
   Who's on the inside? Who's undercover?
   <br/>
   Who looks like you do?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Resolution road
   <br/>
   'Round and 'round and 'round we go
   <br/>
   Who makes the circle and who's in the middle?
   <br/>
   Who talks in reasons and who talks in riddles?
   <br/>
   Who looks like you do?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Don't speak without thinking
   <br/>
   Don't sleep with a stranger when you're drinking
   <br/>
   Don't jump in a ship when it's sinking
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Resolution road
   <br/>
   Learn to speak your heart in code
   <br/>
   Try to embody the laws of encryption
   <br/>
   Try to defy all the laws of description
   <br/>
   Who looks like you do?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Resolution road
   <br/>
   Buy a ticket for the show
   <br/>
   Who talks in riddles? Who talks in reasons?
   <br/>
   What kind of endings do you believe in?
   <br/>
   Who looks like you do?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Don't speak without thinking
   <br/>
   Don't sleep with a stranger when you're drinking
   <br/>
   Don't jump in a ship
   <br/>
   Don't speak without thinking
   <br/>
   Don't sleep with a stranger when you're drinking
   <br/>
   Don't jump in a ship when it's sinking...
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Resolution road
   <br/>
   Who's your friend and who's your foe?
   <br/>
   How do you tell the one from the other?
   <br/>
   Who's on the inside? Who's undercover?
   <br/>
   Who'll be your Lazarus? Who'll be your lover?
   <br/>
   Who looks like you do...?
