     Lyrics

  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When you're looking at life on the brim
   <br/>
   And trying to figure out if you remember how to swim
   <br/>
   You only find out if you jump right in
   <br/>
   That there's only one way, only one way
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And when the writing on the road says slow
   <br/>
   And the people in the back seat ask which way to go
   <br/>
   The truth is they already know
   <br/>
   That there's only one way, only one way
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   We have to break all the rules they make
   <br/>
   And take all the risks they say we won't take
   <br/>
   We have to make all the trouble we can
   <br/>
   Only one way
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Only one way
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And when every single sound you hear makes no sense
   <br/>
   And you arse is sore with sitting on the fence
   <br/>
   And the scale of the problem is larger than immense
   <br/>
   There's only one way
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And when a genocidal maniac talks about grief
   <br/>
   And you kinda get the feeling that there's nothing underneath
   <br/>
   And you can't believe a man would lie through such nice teeth
   <br/>
   There's only one way
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus 2x)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And when you're thinking that there's nothing you can do
   <br/>
   But eat what they feed you like a monkey in the zoo
   <br/>
   Remember that they want you to believe that's true
   <br/>
   And there's only one way, only one way
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus 3x)
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
