  <p align="center">
   I used to think I could live by the law
   <br/>
   And believe everything that my own two eyes saw
   <br/>
   But now all the certainties have come undone
   <br/>
   And it's harder to walk these days than run
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I was always impressed with how Lassie could tell
   <br/>
   The good guys from bad guys just by their smell
   <br/>
   But now they're all odorless, every one
   <br/>
   And it's harder to walk these days than run
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, I read all the books, I thought words could repair
   <br/>
   And I dreamed of a language that everyone shared
   <br/>
   But all reason retreats in the face of the gun
   <br/>
   And it's harder to walk these days than run
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And how can I consider what's wrong and what's right
   <br/>
   When everything moves even faster than light
   <br/>
   I'm not even sure I can trust in the sun
   <br/>
   It's so much harder to walk these days than run
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But you told me everything in its own time
   <br/>
   And you waited for yours and I waited for mine
   <br/>
   And right from the start I knew you were the one
   <br/>
   Who'd make it easier to walk these days
   <br/>
   Easier to walk these days
   <br/>
   Easier to walk these days than run
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Easier to walk these days than run...
  </p>
