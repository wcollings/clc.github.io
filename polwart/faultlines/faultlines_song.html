  <p align="center">
   Have you ever held something until you hands were aching?
   <br/>
   And then let it go and watched it fall and listened to it breaking?
   <br/>
   I have held back time and tide when all the world was plenty
   <br/>
   But now my hands are open wide, open wide and empty
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   For every breath that leaves me now, another comes to fill me
   <br/>
   And for every death that grieves me now, the next will surely kill me
   <br/>
   For those borders crumble every day, the faultlines are showing
   <br/>
   And all I thought was here to stay slowly is going
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   History abandons us and we're holding on, holding on
   <br/>
   To nothing but dirt and dust, we're holding on, holding on
   <br/>
   While those borders crumble every day, the faultlines are showing
   <br/>
   And all I thought was here to stay slowly is going
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Have you ever held something until you hands were aching?
   <br/>
   And then let it go and watched it fall and listened to it breaking?
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
