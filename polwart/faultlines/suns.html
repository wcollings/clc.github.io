  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Six rain-ridden summers and he still had an eye for me
   <br/>
   He kissed me each evening and told me he'd die for me
   <br/>
   And then he ran off the road, full of whisky and irony
   <br/>
   He always meant what he said
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So I took to whisky so I could recall
   <br/>
   The taste of his mouth on my mouth, that's all
   <br/>
   And I tried to same trick with a truck, but it stalled
   <br/>
   The engine was better off dead
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Oh how the nights are long
   <br/>
   But life is longer still
   <br/>
   Oh how the nights are long
   <br/>
   But the sun's coming over the hill
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The taste never left me, and I don't think it will
   <br/>
   And it caused me to supplement whisky with pills
   <br/>
   But there was something inside that I couldn't kill
   <br/>
   Believe me, I really did try
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Now there's some say you get what you deserve, but they're wrong
   <br/>
   Sometimes you get what you're given, and then it's all gone
   <br/>
   And you are lucky if you are sufficiently strong
   <br/>
   To daily decide not to die
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I can't say there's many things I wouldn't change
   <br/>
   There are better days gone than those that remain
   <br/>
   But I can find joy in the sound of the rain
   <br/>
   You have to find joy where you can
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus 2x)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The sun's coming over the hill
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
