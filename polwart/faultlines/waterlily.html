   </b>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Caught between the air and the windless deep
   <br/>
   You float like a lily flower
   <br/>
   And you look just like you fell to earth to sleep
   <br/>
   And you're waiting for your waking hour
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   And I swear to God I saw an angel hand attend you
   <br/>
   But that was just the dancing of the light
   <br/>
   No mortal or immortal did deliver or defend you
   <br/>
   All hands have forsaken you tonight
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Are you dreaming of a lover who will carry you away?
   <br/>
   And keep you from the crying of the crowd?
   <br/>
   No cradle in the rushes, you are broken like the day
   <br/>
   And darkness all around you like a shrowd
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When they finally surrounded you, did any of them face you?
   <br/>
   And did you curse the moon and stars above?
   <br/>
   Those cruel arms abandoned you for water to embrace you
   <br/>
   Won't you lay your head, my waterlily love?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Caught between the air and the windless deep
   <br/>
   You float like a lily flower
   <br/>
   And you look just like you fell to earth to sleep
   <br/>
   And you're waiting for your waking hour
   <br/>
   And you're waiting for your waking hour
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
