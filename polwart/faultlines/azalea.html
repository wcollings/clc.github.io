  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There's a whisper at the window
   <br/>
   I don't know what it is
   <br/>
   Maybe it's the sound of the wind in the azaleas
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Matt's away on business
   <br/>
   And he calls me on the phone
   <br/>
   But it's hard to get to sleep at night when I'm alone
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I pull the sheets around me
   <br/>
   And I hear that sound again
   <br/>
   Maybe it's the sound of the wind in the azaleas
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And when I was young I used to leave a note upon my bed
   <br/>
   And it said, "Dear Mister Robber Man
   <br/>
   Don't shoot me and my sister dead"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I double locked the door downstairs
   <br/>
   I do the same each night
   <br/>
   And I turned out the light
   <br/>
   I turned out the light
   <br/>
   I'm sure I turned out the light
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The lights are on at number five
   <br/>
   They've been on for days and days
   <br/>
   It's the middle of the afternoon in August
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And Billy Marshall checks the porch
   <br/>
   Sees the mail has not been read
   <br/>
   And someone's cut off all the azalea heads
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Matt's on television and he's looking quite distressed
   <br/>
   He says he cannot understand
   <br/>
   The kind of man who would have done this
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He says he didn't call on Tuesday
   <br/>
   'Cause he was working long hours
   <br/>
   And now she's lying
   <br/>
   Now she's lying
   <br/>
   Now she's lying like the azalea flowers
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There's a whisper at the window
   <br/>
   I don't know what it is
   <br/>
   Maybe it's the sound of the wind in the azaleas
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
