  <p align="center">
   You've been waiting for the wind to change direction
   <br/>
   Waiting for the sun to shine
   <br/>
   You've been waiting for a new connection
   <br/>
   But you're walking on the same old line
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You've been waiting so long
   <br/>
   How can you wait a single minute more?
   <br/>
   You've been waiting so long
   <br/>
   You just don't know what you are waiting for
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You've been wishing for a gentle hand to guide you
   <br/>
   For a heavenly sign
   <br/>
   You've been wishing that a spark could burn inside you
   <br/>
   For a little bit more time
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You've been wishing so hard
   <br/>
   How can you now wish for any more?
   <br/>
   You've been wishing so hard
   <br/>
   You just don't know what you are wishing for
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Some say the good things come to all those who wait
   <br/>
   But then again, they might not come at all
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You've been looking to what's just around the corner
   <br/>
   Living for another day
   <br/>
   You've been looking to the distant skyline
   <br/>
   Looking like you've lost your way
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You've been looking so hard for someting
   <br/>
   Your eyes are getting sore
   <br/>
   You've been looking so hard
   <br/>
   You just don't know what you are looking for
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Some say the good things come to all those who wait
   <br/>
   But then again, they might not come at all
   <br/>
   Some say the good things come to all those who wait
   <br/>
   But then again, they might not come at all
  </p>
