  <p align="center">
   Old as I am
   <br/>
   Older than the threads of understanding
   <br/>
   Which we weave between us
   <br/>
   Old as you are
   <br/>
   Older by far than the contours of the love
   <br/>
   Which we leave behind us
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Bold as I am
   <br/>
   Bolder than the pioneers
   <br/>
   Who trekked their way across the desert
   <br/>
   Bold as you are
   <br/>
   Bolder by far than the lovers
   <br/>
   Who have swum the tide to be together
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Are we old enough and bold enough to say good-bye?
   <br/>
   Are we old enough and bold enough that we do not need to cry?
   <br/>
   Well, I'm not so old and not so bold I don't need you more
   <br/>
   Now the light is slowly beckoning you to the shore
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Cold is the ground
   <br/>
   For which you're bound
   <br/>
   It's a place where we can never more be together
   <br/>
   Cold is the air
   <br/>
   That takes you there
   <br/>
   On a passage that will end with your end forever
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But it's not so cold I do not feel the warmth of your skin
   <br/>
   And it's not so cold I do not know the fires that burn within you
   <br/>
   Though they are fading now, I wish that they would blaze once more
   <br/>
   And keep you from the light that's slowly beckoning you to the shore
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   If I could sail the seas of time, then I would keep you from harm
   <br/>
   But I am no sailor and I cannot warn you
   <br/>
   Though there is nothing in my life I ever wanted more
   <br/>
   Than to keep you from the light that's slowly beckoning you
   <br/>
   Than to shield you from the light that's slowly beckoning you to the shore
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
