  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh my dear
   <br/>
   Your waters are wonderous clear
   <br/>
   And the north wind
   <br/>
   Caresses my skin
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   You make me feel
   <br/>
   Like I could relinquish
   <br/>
   This body of stone and steel
   <br/>
   And fly
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And you cradle me like a mother
   <br/>
   And rock me in your arms like a lover
   <br/>
   With your lullaby
   <br/>
   Of water and sky
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh mo chroí
   <br/>
   You're as deep and as wide as the sea
   <br/>
   And you carry me so
   <br/>
   There's nowhere that we can't go
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh how I wish that my heart would rip open
   <br/>
   And you'd fill me with your love like an ocean
   <br/>
   I would be ever so beautifully broken
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You and I
   <br/>
   You and I
   <br/>
   You and I
   <br/>
   You and I
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And the sky
   <br/>
   And the sky
   <br/>
   And the sky
   <br/>
   And the sky
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh my queen
   <br/>
   I want to reveal all that's never been seen
   <br/>
   And show them your power
   <br/>
   That blooms in your belly just like a flower
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Everything holy and everything hidden
   <br/>
   We're holding each other, the loch and the maiden
   <br/>
   We go waltzing around, merry dancers, you and I
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And the sky...
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
