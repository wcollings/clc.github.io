  </p>
  <p align="center">
   On Raglan Road on an autumn day
   <br/>
   I saw her first and knew
   <br/>
   That her dark hair would weave a snare
   <br/>
   That I might one day rue
   <br/>
   I saw the danger, yet I walked
   <br/>
   Along the enchanted way
   <br/>
   And I said, "Let grief be a falling leaf
   <br/>
   At the dawning of the day"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   On Grafton Street in November
   <br/>
   We tripped lightly along the ledge
   <br/>
   Of a deep ravine where can be seen
   <br/>
   The worth of passion's pledge
   <br/>
   The Queen of Hearts still making tarts
   <br/>
   And I not making hay
   <br/>
   Oh I loved too much, and by such, by such
   <br/>
   Is happiness thrown away
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I gave her the gifts of the mind
   <br/>
   I gave her the secret sign that's known
   <br/>
   To the artists who have known the true
   <br/>
   Gods of sound and storm
   <br/>
   And word and tint I not did stint
   <br/>
   For I gave her poems to say
   <br/>
   With her own name there and her long, black hair
   <br/>
   Like clouds over fields of May
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   On a quiet street where old ghosts meet
   <br/>
   I see her walking now
   <br/>
   Away from me so hurriedly
   <br/>
   My reason must allow
   <br/>
   That I had ruled not as I should
   <br/>
   A creature made of clay
   <br/>
   When the angel woos the clay he'll lose
   <br/>
   His wings at the dawn of day
  </p>
