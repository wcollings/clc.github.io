     Lyrics

  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I wish I was in Carrickfergus
   <br/>
   Only for nights in Ballygrand
   <br/>
   I would swim over the deepest ocean
   <br/>
   The deepest ocean for my love to find
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But the sea is wide and I can't swim over
   <br/>
   And neither have I wings to fly
   <br/>
   If I could find me a handsome boatsman
   <br/>
   To ferry me over to my love and die
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   My childhood days bring back sad reflections
   <br/>
   Of happy times spent so long ago
   <br/>
   My childhood friends and my own relations
   <br/>
   Have all passed on now like melting snow
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But I'll spend my days in endless roaming
   <br/>
   Soft is the grass, my bed is free
   <br/>
   Ah, to be back now in Carrickfergus
   <br/>
   On that long road down to the sea
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And in Kilkenny, it is reported
   <br/>
   There are marble stones as black as ink
   <br/>
   With gold and silver I would support her
   <br/>
   But I'll sing no more now 'til I get a drink
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I'm drunk today, but then I'm seldom sober
   <br/>
   A handsome rover from town to town
   <br/>
   But I am sick now, and my days are numbered
   <br/>
   So, come all you young men and lay me down
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
 </body>
