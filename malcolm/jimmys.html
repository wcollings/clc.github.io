  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Jimmy's gone to Flanders, his fiddle lies upon his bed
   <br/>
   It was his father's fiddle, though he's aye been shy to practice it
   <br/>
   Jimmy's gone to Flanders, his fishing creel's a tangle
   <br/>
   From the nicht he and Willie fished the Earn though there was no moon
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Jimmy's gone to Flanders, he spoilt the old dog rotten
   <br/>
   With scraps below the table, though I told him time and time again
   <br/>
   Jimmy's gone to Flanders, his football boots are sodden
   <br/>
   For they've no been near dubbin since he bought them new from Sandy Broon
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   When Jimmy's home from Flanders, he'll be shamed to clean those football boots
   <br/>
   And sort out all thon tangle, for the Earn I hear is fishing good
   <br/>
   When Jimmy's home from Flanders, we'll be sat down by the table
   <br/>
   And we'll coax him to his fiddle, Jimmy, gie's "The Bonawe Highlanders"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Jimmy's gone to Flanders, though he had a job at Logie's yard
   <br/>
   But all the lads were joining, it'll all be over by Christmas time
   <br/>
   Jimmy's gone to Flanders, though he's no' the strength his father was
   <br/>
   I'm sure he'll be worthy and that Jocky would have burst with pride
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Jimmy's gone to Flanders, and I ken he has a lassie
   <br/>
   Her father saw them walking by themselves below the Falls of May
   <br/>
   Jimmy's gone to Flanders, he's as secret as his father was
   <br/>
   But I caught her weeping as the sergeant marched him to the train
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
