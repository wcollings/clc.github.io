   You were the very first before the world began
   <br/>
   And the oceans rose and the rivers ran
   <br/>
   And the water flowed before the mountains and hills were set in place
   <br/>
   Before the stars in the sky and the human race
   <br/>
   You were there, You were there
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Wisdom, teach me what is right
   <br/>
   Widsom, come and give me sight
   <br/>
   Wisdom, come and be my light
   <br/>
   My light
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You are the voice of truth that is just and right
   <br/>
   A shield to the faithful, a sword for the fight
   <br/>
   A path for the wise and those who desire You more than silver or gold
   <br/>
   Will find understanding within the soul
   <br/>
   For You are there, You are there
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus...)
  </p>
