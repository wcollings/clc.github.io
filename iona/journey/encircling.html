   I bind unto myself today
   <br/>
   The power of God to hold and lead
   <br/>
   His eye to watch, His might to stay
   <br/>
   His ear to hearken to my need
   <br/>
   (2x)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The wisdom of my God to teach
   <br/>
   His hand to guide, His shield to ward
   <br/>
   The word of God to give me speech
   <br/>
   His heavenly host to be my guard
   <br/>
   (4x)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The mighty Three my protection be
   <br/>
   Encircling me, You are around
   <br/>
   My life, my home encircling me
   <br/>
   Oh sacred Three, the mighty Three
   <br/>
   (2x)
  </p>
