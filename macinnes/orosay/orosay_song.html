  </p>
  <p align="center">
   A young girl sits impatiently
   <br/>
   Draws her hand across her brow
   <br/>
   Gazes over the machair
   <br/>
   Glances at the clock again
   <br/>
   Some days seem to go on forever
   <br/>
   When all you want is to be on your own
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She wants answers to her questions
   <br/>
   Help to put the world to right
   <br/>
   No school teacher holds the key
   <br/>
   Only He takes time to listen
   <br/>
   Lifts the burden from her young shoulders
   <br/>
   And can heal her fragile soul
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She casts her troubles on the ocean
   <br/>
   Watches them drift away
   <br/>
   Feels the presence of her Savior
   <br/>
   In her secret hideaway
   <br/>
   On the shores of Orosay
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Machair dances to the tune of the wind
   <br/>
   Pretty flowers soothe her eyes
   <br/>
   Hears the rush of the Atlantic
   <br/>
   Tastes the salt in the air
   <br/>
   Tide's coming in, she's nearly there
   <br/>
   School is now forgotten
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The breeze tousles her hair
   <br/>
   Across the causeway she runs
   <br/>
   Makes it there only minutes to spare
   <br/>
   Sits alone, no one can touch her now
   <br/>
   On a warm Hebridean night she bears her soul
   <br/>
   To the One who created it all
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She casts her troubles on the ocean
   <br/>
   Watches them drift away
   <br/>
   Feels the power of her secret hideaway
   <br/>
   On the shores of Orosay
   <br/>
   She feels the spirit of her friend
   <br/>
   On the shores of Orosay
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
