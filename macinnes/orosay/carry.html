   I remember the day I left my home
   <br/>
   I had no choice, I had to go
   <br/>
   Fuadach nan Gaidheal am goirt agus searbh
   <br/>
   The blood is strong and heart is Highland
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Across the sea, over rugged land
   <br/>
   Looking for work and a place to sleep
   <br/>
   Feelings of home were always with me
   <br/>
   Of friends and family left behind
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Carry me, carry me across the ocean
   <br/>
   Back to my home in the hills
   <br/>
   Where as a child I played with my brothers
   <br/>
   By the Sannox in the Northern glen
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I often think when I'm alone
   <br/>
   Of the Arran run rig far away
   <br/>
   Does the erne still soar high above
   <br/>
   The turquoise waves of Sannox Bay?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The Caledonia lies stormbound on the Lawrence
   <br/>
   Waiting for God to set her free
   <br/>
   Slowly gliding, river widening
   <br/>
   Her final journey homeward without me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Carry me, carry me across the ocean
   <br/>
   Back to my home in the hills
   <br/>
   Where as a child I played with my brothers
   <br/>
   By the Sannox in the Northern glen
   <br/>
   (2x)
  </p>
