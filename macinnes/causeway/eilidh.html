  <p align="center">
   Many years ago when I was in my prime
   <br/>
   I met with bonnie Eilidh around the harvest time
   <br/>
   I courted her so well that she said she would be mine
   <br/>
   And I won my darling Eilidh
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   As we were walking all along the golden sand
   <br/>
   Sweetly she'd turn and hold me by the hand
   <br/>
   She'd look into my eyes, and it made me feel so grand
   <br/>
   To be with you, my darling Eilidh
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Down to the glen where the wild eagles fly
   <br/>
   Down to the place where my bonnie Eilidh lies
   <br/>
   I'll brush away the tears and I'll try not to cry
   <br/>
   As I think of my darling Eilidh
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   My life is fading with each falling grain of sand
   <br/>
   Soon I must go to a far and distant land
   <br/>
   I hope that once I'm there, I'll again hold the hand
   <br/>
   Of my own dear darling Eilidh
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Down to the glen where the pines, they grow tall
   <br/>
   There I'll lie down and await the angels' call
   <br/>
   For all I want to do is die after all
   <br/>
   And be with you, my darling Eilidh
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Sweet grows the heather on the side of the hill
   <br/>
   Where I would go walking with my Eilidh McGill
   <br/>
   I loved her then and I love her still
   <br/>
   How I miss you, my darling Eilidh
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
