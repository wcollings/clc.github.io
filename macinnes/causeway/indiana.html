   Fare thee well now, Indiana
   <br/>
   Your green land's been good to me
   <br/>
   There I've travelled, there I've settled
   <br/>
   There I've raised up my family
   <br/>
   But the cord has never severed
   <br/>
   And our longing each day has grown
   <br/>
   So tomorrow I'll be leaving
   <br/>
   For the land I call my home
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   All my friends, they say I'm crazy
   <br/>
   Going back to such poverty
   <br/>
   Americay is, so they say now
   <br/>
   The land of opportunity
   <br/>
   But the red deer run so freely
   <br/>
   And the heron slowly flies
   <br/>
   There are treasures from my homeland
   <br/>
   That money cannot buy
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And while the ship lies in the harbor
   <br/>
   I will look back upon the shore
   <br/>
   I feel sadness that I'm leaving
   <br/>
   Your green land forevermore
   <br/>
   And while the ship lies on the ocean
   <br/>
   And each day we're out on the sea
   <br/>
   All the dreams I've had for years now
   <br/>
   Draw nearer to reality
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So fare thee well now, Indiana
   <br/>
   Your green land's been good to me
   <br/>
   There I've travelled, there I've settled
   <br/>
   There I've raised up my family
   <br/>
   But the cord has never severed
   <br/>
   And our longing each day has grown
   <br/>
   So tomorrow I'll be leaving
   <br/>
   For the land I call my home
  </p>
