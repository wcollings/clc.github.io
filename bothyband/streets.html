     Lyrics

  </p>
  <p align="center">
   My love is one of the fairest young men
   <br/>
   That ever was in this country
   <br/>
   But how to win him, I do not know it
   <br/>
   For he is sentenced for to die
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   As he walked out the streets of Derry
   <br/>
   He walked so proud and so manfully
   <br/>
   He was far more like a commanding officer
   <br/>
   Than a man to die on the gallow's tree
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The first time he went to climb the ladder
   <br/>
   His blooming face began to pale
   <br/>
   And this he said, "Is there no assistance?
   <br/>
   Is there no __ in Derry jail?"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He took another step up the ladder
   <br/>
   His beloved father was standing by
   <br/>
   "Come here, come near, my beloved father
   <br/>
   And speak one word to me before I die"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The next time he went to climb the ladder
   <br/>
   His beloved sister was standing by
   <br/>
   "Come here, come near, my beloved sister
   <br/>
   And speak one word to me before I die"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I wonder what become of my true love
   <br/>
   Or what has sent her so long from me?
   <br/>
   Or does she think it a great dishonor
   <br/>
   For to see me die on a gallow's tree?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He looked around and he saw her coming
   <br/>
   And she was dressed up in woolens fine
   <br/>
   And then he stepped, and she draws nearer
   <br/>
   Was swifter than the __ wine
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Come down, come down off that weary gallow
   <br/>
   For I've got your pardon from the king
   <br/>
   And I'll let them see we'll be united
   <br/>
   And I'll crown my Johnny with a laurel leaf
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
