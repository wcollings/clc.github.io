  </p>
  <p align="center">
   From sweet Londonderry to fair London town
   <br/>
   There is no other nicer harbor anywhere to be found
   <br/>
   Where the children each evening is a-playin' 'round the shore
   <br/>
   And the joy bells are ringin' for the maid of Coolmore
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The first time that I met her, she passed me by
   <br/>
   The next time that I met her, she bade me good-bye
   <br/>
   But the last time that I met her, she grieved my heart sore
   <br/>
   For she sailed down Lough Foyle and away from Coolmore
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   If I had the power, the storm to rise
   <br/>
   I would blow the wind higher for to darken the skies
   <br/>
   I would blow the wind higher to make the salt seas to roar
   <br/>
   On the day that my love sailed away from Coolmore
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   To the north of America my love I'll search for
   <br/>
   For there I know no one, nor no one knows me
   <br/>
   But should I not find her, I'll return home no more
   <br/>
   But like a pilgrim I will wander for the maid of Coolmore
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The first time that I met her, she passed me by
   <br/>
   The next time that I met her, she bade me good-bye
   <br/>
   But the last time that I met her, she grieved my heart sore
   <br/>
   For she sailed down Lough Foyle and away from Coolmore
  </p>
