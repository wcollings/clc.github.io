  <p align="center">
   As I went down yon heathery moor
   <br/>
   I met a bonny wee lassie
   <br/>
   She winked at me and passed me by
   <br/>
   And oh but she was handsome
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus (after each verse)
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   With my twadigan adigan antin aye
   <br/>
   With my twadigan adigan aye do
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Where are you going, my bonny wee lass?
   <br/>
   Where are you going, my honey?"
   <br/>
   Quite mannerly she answered me
   <br/>
   "On a message for me mammy"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Oh what's your age, my bonny wee lassie?
   <br/>
   Oh what's your age, my honey?"
   <br/>
   Quite mannerly she answered me
   <br/>
   "I'll be sixteen come next Sunday"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Oh where do you live, my bonny wee lass?
   <br/>
   Oh where do you live, my honey?"
   <br/>
   Quite mannerly she answered me
   <br/>
   "Away down in yon green valley"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Oh where do you lie, my bonny wee lass?
   <br/>
   Oh where do you lie, my honey?"
   <br/>
   Quite mannerly she answered me
   <br/>
   "In the bed behind me mammy"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Will you marry me, my bonny wee lass?
   <br/>
   Will you marry me, my honey?"
   <br/>
   Quite mannerly she answered me
   <br/>
   "Will you wait 'til I ask me mammy?"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "If I go down the morrow night
   <br/>
   When the moon will be shining clearly
   <br/>
   Will you open the door and let me in?
   <br/>
   And your mammy, she won't hear me"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   As I went down to her house
   <br/>
   Her mammy chanced to hear me
   <br/>
   She pulled her daughter by the hair
   <br/>
   And she hit her three times over
  </p>
