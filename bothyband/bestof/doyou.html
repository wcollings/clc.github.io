   Do you love an apple? Do you love a pear?
   <br/>
   Do you love a laddie with bonnie brown hair?

   <u>
    Chorus (after each verse)
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   But still I love him, I can't deny him
   <br/>
   I'll be with him wherever he goes
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Before I got married I wore a black shawl
   <br/>
   But since I got married I wear bugger all
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He stood at the corner, a fag in his mouth
   <br/>
   Two hands in his pockets, he whistled me out
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He works at the pier for nine bob a week
   <br/>
   Come Saturday night, he comes rolling home drunk
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Before I got married I'd sport and I'd play
   <br/>
   But now, the cradle, it gets in me way
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Do you love an apple? Do you love a pear?
   <br/>
   Do you love a laddie with bonnie brown hair?
  </p>
