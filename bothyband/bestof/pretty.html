   When pretty Peg went down the street
   <br/>
   Some fresh fish for to buy
   <br/>
   But the wee town clerk followed after her
   <br/>
   And he kissed her by and by
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Chorus (after each verse):
   <br/>
   With my tiddy-right-fol-da-liddle-dido
   <br/>
   With my tiddy-right-fol-da-liddle-day
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Oh how can I get to your chamber, love?
   <br/>
   Or how can I get to your bed?
   <br/>
   When your daddy goes to bed at night
   <br/>
   With a keen eye on his head?"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Oh go and get the ladder, love
   <br/>
   With thirty steps and three
   <br/>
   And put it to the chimney top
   <br/>
   And come down in a creel to me"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "I went and got a ladder, love
   <br/>
   With thirty steps and three
   <br/>
   And a creel on the top of that
   <br/>
   And come down in the lum to thee"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   No peace nor ease could the old wife get
   <br/>
   With dreams running through her head
   <br/>
   "I'll lay on me life," said the gay old wife
   <br/>
   "There's a boy in me daughter's bed"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Then up the stairs the old man crept
   <br/>
   And into the room did steal
   <br/>
   Silence reigned where the daughter slept
   <br/>
   And he never twigged the creel
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "My curse attend you, father
   <br/>
   What brought you up so soon?
   <br/>
   To put me through my evening prayers
   <br/>
   And I just lying down?"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He went back to his gay old wife
   <br/>
   He went back to she
   <br/>
   "She has the prayer book in her hand
   <br/>
   And she's praying for you and me"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   No peace nor ease could that old wife get
   <br/>
   'Til she would rise and see
   <br/>
   She came on a stumbling-block
   <br/>
   And into the creel went she
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Oh high I rocked her, oh I rocked her
   <br/>
   Didn't I rock her well?
   <br/>
   For if any old wife begrudge me her daughter
   <br/>
   I'll rock her into hell"
  </p>
