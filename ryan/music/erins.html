  </p>
  <p align="center">
   My father, he being a farmer reared to industry
   <br/>
   He had four sons, two men who'd grown, and lovely daughters three
   <br/>
   Our land's too small to serve us all so some of us must roam
   <br/>
   Our friends may mourn for we'll never return to Erin's lovely home
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   My father, he sold the second cow and he borrowed twenty pounds
   <br/>
   It was in the pleasant month of May we sailed from Belfast town
   <br/>
   With thousands more we left our shore in safety to roam
   <br/>
   Our friends may mourn for we'll never return to Erin's lovely home
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We hadn't been long sailing when fever seized our crew
   <br/>
   Falling like the autumn leaves and overboard were threw
   <br/>
   The ocean waves, they rolled o'er our graves, our bed the ocean foam
   <br/>
   Our friends may mourn for we'll never return to Erin's lovely home
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
