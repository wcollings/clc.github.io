  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There was a stand of oak trees beside my father's house
   <br/>
   The wind blew through the leaves, I can hear it now
   <br/>
   The smell of hay just stacked in the back field
   <br/>
   Glowing gold in the summer heat
   <br/>
   In the softness of the rain
   <br/>
   I can hear us laugh again
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Wake, my heart, play the Bucks of Oranmore
   <br/>
   Shake my mind, put the devil in the bow once more
   <br/>
   Fray the hair, bend the note, lift the dancer's feet
   <br/>
   I'm going, I'm gone, I'm going back to Ireland
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You were the King of Dublin, and I was your Queen Maeve
   <br/>
   We ran headlong through the fields, we knew every lane
   <br/>
   We knew the land had a wisdom of its own
   <br/>
   Laying back on ancient stone
   <br/>
   We heard the River Shannon sing
   <br/>
   And we were never gonna leave
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Through the tangled grass near the gorse
   <br/>
   We would sit and plot our course
   <br/>
   Back when my thoughts were so clear
   <br/>
   Back in time when you were here
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I'm going back
   <br/>
   I'm going back
   <br/>
   I'm going back
  </p>
