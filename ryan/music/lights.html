  <p align="center">
   The lights of San Francisco shone on the city floor
   <br/>
   Joe worked on in the city 'til the dawn came around once more
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He came from Galway, came over recently
   <br/>
   And Lucy from the USA smiled at his naivete
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   In the rocky places of his heart no one had ever seen
   <br/>
   Lucy picking cockles and Lucy planting seeds
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Came the marching bands of July and their silver shadows flew
   <br/>
   Two by two, red and blue, through the summer evening
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He said, "All my troubles never wander very far
   <br/>
   I like to hear music, but I like it on a blue guitar"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "And there is no end to the money a guy wants to hold in his hand
   <br/>
   The sky hung with airplanes and no peace upon the land"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "And the folks on television that lie with every breath
   <br/>
   And insult you with visions of cheap life and cheaper death"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "And there is no home for me now, but I'll go on loving you
   <br/>
   'Til there is no more music and the guitar is no longer blue"
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
