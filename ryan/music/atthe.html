  </p>
  <p align="center">
   At the foot of Knocknarea I pick up a stone
   <br/>
   To carry to the top with all my troubles
   <br/>
   I'll lay it on Maeve's cairn high upon that mound
   <br/>
   Stone upon hard stone I'll lay it down
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I have a man at home who wants more than I can give
   <br/>
   And a child who needs at least that much and better
   <br/>
   My heart is pulled tight, Maeve
   <br/>
   In this home that I have made
   <br/>
   At the foot of Knocknarea
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I hear a music play as great as any love
   <br/>
   I carry for my husband and my daughter
   <br/>
   It calls me from their reach, I look back with no ease
   <br/>
   Can they stay a while alone and leave me be?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "No," says the voice that answers in my head
   <br/>
   It's the voice that has been droning on forever
   <br/>
   It's my mother's music, Maeve
   <br/>
   I sing with it always
   <br/>
   As I climb up Knocknarea
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And the wind, it does rage here on Knocknarea
   <br/>
   It's a rage that I've learned all too well
   <br/>
   I will speak the truth from now
   <br/>
   And show my young girl how
   <br/>
   For her voice depends on mine
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   At the foot of Knocknarea I pick up a stone
   <br/>
   To carry to the top with all my troubles
   <br/>
   I'll lay it on Maeve's cairn high upon that mound
   <br/>
   Stone upon hard stone I'll lay it down
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   At the foot of Knocknarea I pick up a stone
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
