  <p align="center">
   The yellow bittern that never broke out
   <br/>
   In a drinking bout might as well have drunk
   <br/>
   His bones are thrown on a naked stone
   <br/>
   Where he lived alone like a hermit monk
   <br/>
   Oh yellow bittern, I pity your lot
   <br/>
   Though they say that a sot like myself is cursed
   <br/>
   I was sober a while, but I'll drink and be wise
   <br/>
   For fear I should die in the end of thirst
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It's not for the common birds that I'd mourn
   <br/>
   The blackbird, the corncrake or the crane
   <br/>
   But for the bittern that's shy and apart
   <br/>
   And drinks in the marsh from the lone bog drain
   <br/>
   Oh if I had known you were near your death
   <br/>
   While my breath held out I'd have run to you
   <br/>
   'Til a splash from the Lake of the Son of the Bird
   <br/>
   Your soul would have stirred and waked anew
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   My darling told me to drink no more
   <br/>
   Or my life would be o'er in a little short while
   <br/>
   But I told her 'tis drink gives me health and strength
   <br/>
   And will lengthen my road by many a mile
   <br/>
   You see how the bird of the long smooth neck
   <br/>
   Could get his death from the thirst at last
   <br/>
   Come, son of my soul, and drink your cup
   <br/>
   For you'll get no sup when your life is past
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
 </body>
