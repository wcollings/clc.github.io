  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We dreamed our dreams as we walked on the Wicklow byway
   <br/>
   Your promise came like a lark's refrain, warm and true
   <br/>
   And I gave my promise, too
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We dreamed our dreams as we kissed in the summer gladness
   <br/>
   And then the cry, it would be good-bye and you'd be gone
   <br/>
   Like the swallow, you'd be gone
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   With autumn's chill in my hills I stood alone
   <br/>
   I called your name and heard a silence
   <br/>
   Where are you now?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Where are you now as I linger where vows were whispered?
   <br/>
   Another spring the sweet lark sings, I feel the pain
   <br/>
   Did we dream our dreams in vain?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We dreamed our dreams as we walked on the Wicklow byway
   <br/>
   Your promise came like a lark's refrain, warm and true
   <br/>
   And I gave my promise, too
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
