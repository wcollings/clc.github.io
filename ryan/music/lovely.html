  <p align="center">
   It happened one evening at the playing of ball
   <br/>
   When first I met Willie, both proper and tall
   <br/>
   He was neat, fair and handsome and straight in each limb
   <br/>
   There's a heart in my bosom lies breaking for him
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Oh won't you come with me a short piece of the road
   <br/>
   To see my father's dwelling and place of abode?"
   <br/>
   He could tell by her looks and her languishing eye
   <br/>
   That he was the young man she had cherished most high
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "There's a spot in my father's garden, lovely Willie," said she
   <br/>
   "Where lords, dukes, and earls there wait upon me
   <br/>
   But when they are sleeping in a long and silent rest
   <br/>
   I'll go with you, lovely Willie, you're the boy I love best"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Her father'd been listening, in ambush he lay
   <br/>
   To hear the fond words that these lovers did say
   <br/>
   And with a sharp rapier he pierced her love through
   <br/>
   And the innocent blood of her lover he drew
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The grave was got ready, lovely Willie laid in
   <br/>
   The mass, it was chanted to clear his soul of sin
   <br/>
   "You, honored father, you may say as you will
   <br/>
   But the innocent blood of my love you did spill
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So I will go off to some far country
   <br/>
   Where I will know no one, and no one know me
   <br/>
   There I will wander 'til I close my eyes in rest
   <br/>
   For you, lovely Willie, you're the boy I love best"
  </p>
