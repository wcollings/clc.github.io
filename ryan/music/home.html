   In Scartaglen there lived a lass
   <br/>
   And every Sunday after mass
   <br/>
   She would go and take a glass
   <br/>
   Before going home by Bearna
   <br/>
   We won't go home along the road
   <br/>
   For fear that you might act the rogue
   <br/>
   Won't go home along the road
   <br/>
   But we'll go home by Bearna
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We won't go home across the fields
   <br/>
   The big thornins will stick in your heels
   <br/>
   We won't go home across the fields
   <br/>
   But we'll go home by Bearna
   <br/>
   We won't go home around the glen
   <br/>
   For fear your blood might rise again
   <br/>
   Won't go home around the glen
   <br/>
   But we'll go home by Bearna
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We won't go down the milk boreen
   <br/>
   The night is bright, we might be seen
   <br/>
   We won't go down the milk boreen
   <br/>
   But we'll go home by Bearna
   <br/>
   We won't go home across the bog
   <br/>
   For fear we might meet Kearney's dog
   <br/>
   We won't go home across the bog
   <br/>
   But we'll go home by Bearna
  </p>
  <p align="center">
