   There was a fire in the sky over Gratiot
   <br/>
   You could see it all the way from Springwells
   <br/>
   Standing on the front lawn in the blackness
   <br/>
   Holding fast to mama's knees
   <br/>
   The whole block on the street
   <br/>
   When Detroit was burning
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Dad said this had been coming for sometime
   <br/>
   The black guys on the line had told him so
   <br/>
   The city of the ghettoes burned on fire
   <br/>
   There was nothing on the news
   <br/>
   But all the neighbors knew
   <br/>
   When Detroit was burning
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When Detroit was burning, burning down
   <br/>
   When Detroit was burning, burning down
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There were no kids in the park on Saturday
   <br/>
   The Guardsmen set up tents under the swings
   <br/>
   They drove their jeeps around Vernor Highway
   <br/>
   Then they'd go downtown at night
   <br/>
   And shoot everything in sight
   <br/>
   When Detroit was burning
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I was just a little girl playing with my friends
   <br/>
   I didn't know what it meant to live in a black kid's skin
   <br/>
   I'm older now and there's still so much I don't understand
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The farmer's market's thriving down on Gratiot
   <br/>
   But there's fire in the night around Springwells
   <br/>
   Detroit wasn't reborn from the ashes
   <br/>
   It's been nearly thirty years
   <br/>
   And hate's still living here
   <br/>
   Where Detroit was burning
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When Detroit was burning, burning down
   <br/>
   When Detroit was burning, burning down
   <br/>
   Our hometown burning down
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
