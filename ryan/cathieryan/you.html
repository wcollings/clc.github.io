  <p align="center">
   A nobleman's fair daughter was walking down yon lane
   <br/>
   When up comes Captain Dixon, the keeper of the game
   <br/>
   Says he unto his serving man, "If it was not for the law
   <br/>
   I'd have that maid within my bed and she'd lie next to the wall"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Go away, young man," says she, "And do not me perplex
   <br/>
   Before I lie one night with you, you'll answer questions six
   <br/>
   Six questions you will answer, and I will make them all
   <br/>
   Before you and I in the one bed lie and I lie next to the wall
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   What is rounder than a ring? What's higher than a tree?
   <br/>
   What is worse than womankind? What's deeper than the sea?
   <br/>
   What tree blooms first? What bird sings best? From where do dew drops fall?
   <br/>
   Then it's you and I in the one bed lie and I lie next to the wall"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "A globe is rounder than a ring, sky higher than a tree
   <br/>
   A girl is worse than womankind, hell deeper than the sea
   <br/>
   The yew blooms first, the thrush sings best, from heaven the dew drops fall
   <br/>
   So it's you and I in the one bed lie and you lie next to the wall"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "You must get for me some winter fruit that in December grew
   <br/>
   Find for me a mantle, a weft it never went through
   <br/>
   A sparrow's horn, a priest unshorn, a bird without a gaul
   <br/>
   Then it's you and I in the one bed lie and I lie next to the wall"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "My father has some winter fruit that in December grew
   <br/>
   My mother wears a mantle, a weft it never went through
   <br/>
   A sparrow's horn's not hard to find, there's one in every claw
   <br/>
   Melchizedek is a priest unshorn," and he rolled her to the wall
  </p>
