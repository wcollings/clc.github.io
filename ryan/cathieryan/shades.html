  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I am going to the country, going down that verdant lane
   <br/>
   With nothing but a whistle in my hand and a pocket full of rain
   <br/>
   Can you hear that distant sound coming down the West Clare Railway?
   <br/>
   And running with the shades of gloria
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The wind is full of memories that murmur and sigh
   <br/>
   Hills rise in the foaming grass of Clare beneath the cold moon's eye
   <br/>
   But you should come and see them now, when they are on fire
   <br/>
   And running with the shades of gloria
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The waves roll at the headland when the tide is rising there
   <br/>
   But here, there is starlight falling down on the hills of Clare
   <br/>
   I knew them when I was hungry and I knew them when I was scared
   <br/>
   And running with the shades of gloria
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I am going to the country where Micho in his prime
   <br/>
   Weaved a thread of melody in his own sweet time
   <br/>
   You can hear him sing and whistle anytime you care
   <br/>
   To go running with the shades of gloria
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I am going to the country, going down that verdant lane
   <br/>
   With nothing but a whistle in my hand and a pocket full of rain
  </p>
 </body>
