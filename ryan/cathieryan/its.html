  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Emma worked a lifetime toward her better life
   <br/>
   She built up her shelter in the prayers of younger nights
   <br/>
   She made hard choices, she measured every one
   <br/>
   Somehow she carried with her what she was running from
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   It's a long road that has no turn
   <br/>
   You need a little rest to accept what you have learned
   <br/>
   Then you will turn
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Emma gave him everything and vowed to leave no scars
   <br/>
   Still the child she loved chose the darkness of the bars
   <br/>
   Where did she go wrong? She tries hard to recall
   <br/>
   She has seen her love not make a difference at all
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Leave those dreams down on the side of that road
   <br/>
   You can stand there forever, but you can't make them get up and go
   <br/>
   Believe me, I know
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Emma walked a lifetime down that almighty road
   <br/>
   Missing all the signposts, looking out for holes and stones
   <br/>
   Sometimes life leaves you threadbare to the bone
   <br/>
   And strips away every voice but the one that is your own
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You will turn
   <br/>
   You will turn
  </p>
