  <p align="center">
   Come pledge again your heart and your hand
   <br/>
   One grasp that never will sever
   <br/>
   Our password be our native land
   <br/>
   Our motto, love forever
   <br/>
   And let the orange lily be
   <br/>
   Your badge, my patriot brother
   <br/>
   It's the everlasting green for me
   <br/>
   And we for one another
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Behold how green the gallant stem
   <br/>
   On which the flower is blooming
   <br/>
   How in one heavenly breeze and beam
   <br/>
   Both flower and stem are glowing
   <br/>
   The same good soil sustaining both
   <br/>
   Makes both united flourish
   <br/>
   But cannot give the orange growth
   <br/>
   And cease the green to nourish
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The more the hand that plucks that flower
   <br/>
   Will vainly strive to cherish
   <br/>
   In that hour the stem blooms on
   <br/>
   The flower, it begins to perish
   <br/>
   Regard them then of equal worth
   <br/>
   While last their genial weather
   <br/>
   The time's at hand when deep in earth
   <br/>
   They will both sink together
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And though it be in our country's cause
   <br/>
   Our party feelings blended
   <br/>
   'Til lasting peace from equal laws
   <br/>
   On both will have descended
   <br/>
   'Til then the orange lily be
   <br/>
   Your badge, my patriot brother
   <br/>
   It's the everlasting green for me
   <br/>
   And we for one another
   <br/>
   And we for one another
  </p>
