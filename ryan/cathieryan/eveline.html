  <p align="center">
   It's early Sunday morning, her father's fast asleep
   <br/>
   She's staring out the window at the dark and lonely street
   <br/>
   Put the kettle on the fire, wake the children up for mass
   <br/>
   His drunken cursing last night means another week has passed
   <br/>
   The next will be the same
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It's all right, Eveline, let the ship sail away
   <br/>
   Hold onto the railing and cry
   <br/>
   It won't be the last one, I promise you that
   <br/>
   He's only telling you lies
   <br/>
   He's only telling you lies
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Where is you sailor, Evy? Are you killed with regret?
   <br/>
   Didn't he know your heart then? Did he make you forget
   <br/>
   That you have always seen yourself in your father's bitter eyes?
   <br/>
   Your mother willed her life to you long before she died
   <br/>
   Her madness calls your name
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It's all right, Eveline, let the ship sail away
   <br/>
   Hold onto the railing and cry
   <br/>
   It won't be the last one, I promise you that
   <br/>
   They're only telling you lies
   <br/>
   They're only telling you lies
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Deravaun seraun, deravaun seraun
   <br/>
   Take her hand, take her life
   <br/>
   Take her hand, take her life
   <br/>
   Deravaun seraun, deravaun seraun Eveline
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I knew you were no fiction when he left you on the shore
   <br/>
   Living out the legacy, the guilt of wanting more
   <br/>
   Waiting for a ship to come, praying for strength to leap
   <br/>
   Those leaps are terrifying, the small steps make us free
   <br/>
   The small steps make us free
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It's all right, Eveline, let the ship sail away
   <br/>
   Hold onto the railing and cry
   <br/>
   It won't be the last one, I promise you that
   <br/>
   They're only telling you lies
   <br/>
   They're only telling you lies
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   They're only telling you lies
  </p>
