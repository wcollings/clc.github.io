  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When first we met, complete awkward strangers
   <br/>
   We did not know if we could be friends
   <br/>
   How soon we've come for to know each other
   <br/>
   And now I know we will meet again
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   So here's to you and our time together
   <br/>
   I'll share with you a parting glass
   <br/>
   And I'll bid adieu with some smiles and laughter
   <br/>
   Our time apart will be short and pass
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We've talked of dreams and of new tomorrows
   <br/>
   Of yesterday and its dark despair
   <br/>
   We've had our share of love and sorrow
   <br/>
   And now we part as friends who care
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   A long, long road, it lies before me
   <br/>
   And fate will take me where it will
   <br/>
   But through the valleys and over mountains
   <br/>
   I'll not forget, but remember you still
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus 2x)
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
