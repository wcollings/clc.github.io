  <p align="center">
   A daffodil is born and rises in the spring
   <br/>
   It opens out its beauty to hear the cricket sing
   <br/>
   But as quick as it does grow, it decays away too soon
   <br/>
   Before the summer sunshine has reached its golden noon
   <br/>
   Before the summer sunshine has reached its golden noon
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   A stream, it does rise in the mountains so tall
   <br/>
   It swells into a river, as gently it does fall
   <br/>
   It meanders through valley, through city and through town
   <br/>
   And to the boundless ocean this river, it is bound
   <br/>
   And to the boundless ocean this river, it is bound
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   On the sea the winds do rage and the waves grow so high
   <br/>
   White around their surface as they reach up to the sky
   <br/>
   But soon the waves grow gentle, no longer do they roar
   <br/>
   As they make their lonesome passageway up to the pebble shore
   <br/>
   As they make their lonesome passageway up to the pebble shore
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   If I were like a daffodil so fair upon the ground
   <br/>
   Or like a winding river with its sweet and mellow sound
   <br/>
   Like a wave up to the shore, like a river into the sea
   <br/>
   I'll lay down in my resting place, contented I will be
   <br/>
   I'll lay down in my resting place, contented I will be
  </p>
