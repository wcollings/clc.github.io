   As I look at the valley down below
   <br/>
   It is green just as far as I can see
   <br/>
   As my memory returns, how my heart does yearn
   <br/>
   For you and the days that used to be
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   High on a mountain living free
   <br/>
   Thinking about the days that used to be
   <br/>
   High on a mountain standing alone
   <br/>
   Wondering where the years of my life have gone
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I wonder if you ever think of me
   <br/>
   Or if time's blotted out your memory
   <br/>
   As I listen to the breeze blow gently through the trees
   <br/>
   I'll always cherish what you meant to me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   High on a mountain living free
   <br/>
   Thinking about the days that used to be
   <br/>
   High on a mountain standing alone
   <br/>
   Wondering where the years of my life have gone
   <br/>
