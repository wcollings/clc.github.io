  </p>
  <p align="center">
   In Monument Valley we ride
   <br/>
   Myself and my Navajo guide
   <br/>
   I'm moved by the majesty that lives here in this place
   <br/>
   His native home, the dry desert of his race
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I don't know these mesas or these lands
   <br/>
   Like the fields my mother plowed beside her dad
   <br/>
   And I hold every story that her father told to me
   <br/>
   As dear as myths of the Anasazi
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We ride on and sing our peoples' songs
   <br/>
   From roots that run as deep as they do long
   <br/>
   And although I was born here and raised in this nation
   <br/>
   The blood is strong in the first generation
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   My grandmother swept a dirt floor
   <br/>
   As the Navajo did here before
   <br/>
   Kayenta and Kerry may be wide water apart
   <br/>
   But we're alike in the deep core of the heart
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I've seen the sun set at The Sun's Eye
   <br/>
   Left an echo in The Hogan nearby
   <br/>
   A song of my people that my mother gave to me
   <br/>
   In my tribe music is blood memory
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Music is blood memory
  </p>
