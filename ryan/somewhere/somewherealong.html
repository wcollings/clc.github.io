  <p align="center">
   Somewhere along the road
   <br/>
   Someone waits for me
   <br/>
   Beyond the present storms that blow
   <br/>
   Waiting patiently
   <br/>
   No secrets held in an open heart
   <br/>
   A spirit that soars over mountains
   <br/>
   Somewhere along the road
   <br/>
   Someone waits for me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Somehow a guiding light
   <br/>
   Always shows the way
   <br/>
   To those who lose their way by night
   <br/>
   Searching for the day
   <br/>
   A day away from happiness
   <br/>
   Tomorrow will bring a new sunrise
   <br/>
   Somewhere along the road
   <br/>
   Someone waits for me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Sometimes when winds are still
   <br/>
   Unexpectedly
   <br/>
   Perhaps beyond this silent hill
   <br/>
   A voice will come to me
   <br/>
   Raise your eyes and see my world
   <br/>
   Raise your voice and sing out
   <br/>
   Somewhere along the road
   <br/>
   Someone waits for me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Somewhere along the road
   <br/>
   Someone waits for me
   <br/>
   Beyond the present storms that blow
   <br/>
   Waiting patiently
   <br/>
   No secrets held in an open heart
   <br/>
   A spirit that soars over mountains
   <br/>
   Somewhere along the road
   <br/>
   Someone waits for me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Somewhere along the road
   <br/>
   Someone waits for me
  </p>
