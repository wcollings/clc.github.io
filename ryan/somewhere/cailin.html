  <p align="center">
   It being on a fine summer's morning
   <br/>
   As the birds sweetly tuned on each bower
   <br/>
   I heard a fair maid sing most charming
   <br/>
   As she sat milking her cow
   <br/>
   Her voice was enchanting melodious
   <br/>
   Which left me scarce able to go
   <br/>
   My heart, it was soothed with solace
   <br/>
   By the cail&iacute;n deas cr&uacute;ite na mb&oacute;
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I courteously did salute her
   <br/>
   "Good morning, most amiable maid
   <br/>
   I'm your captive slave for the future"
   <br/>
   "Kind sir, do not banter," she said
   <br/>
   "I'm not such a precious rare jewel
   <br/>
   That I should enamour you so
   <br/>
   I am but a plain county girl"
   <br/>
   Says the cail&iacute;n deas cr&uacute;ite na mb&oacute;
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "The Indies afford no such jewels
   <br/>
   So precious, so transparent clear
   <br/>
   Oh do not refuse me, my jewel
   <br/>
   Consent now and love me, my dear
   <br/>
   For riches I care not a farthing
   <br/>
   It's your love that I want and no more
   <br/>
   I'd rather live poor on the mountain
   <br/>
   With my cail&iacute;n deas cr&uacute;ite na mb&oacute;"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "I don't understand what you mean, sir
   <br/>
   I ne'er was a slave yet to love
   <br/>
   For these feelings I have no desire
   <br/>
   I pray your affection remove
   <br/>
   To marry, I can assure you
   <br/>
   That state I will not undergo
   <br/>
   I'm prepared to live single and airy"
   <br/>
   Says the cail&iacute;n deas cr&uacute;ite na mb&oacute;
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
