  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Now in sailor's clothes Granuaile did go
   <br/>
   A bold sea captain from top to toe
   <br/>
   Her clans and children were the greatest care
   <br/>
   Of Grace O'Malley, of Grace O'Malley
   <br/>
   Who never did despair
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Her trade was maintainence by land and sea
   <br/>
   Two hundred loyal men were her army
   <br/>
   No other captain was as skilled or brave
   <br/>
   As Grace O'Malley, as Grace O'Malley
   <br/>
   Who ruled the stormy wave
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Now they had not sailed far from Clew Bay
   <br/>
   When she spied a vessel bound for Galway
   <br/>
   "Those are sea merchants," Grania did cry
   <br/>
   "And Granuaile, and Granuaile
   <br/>
   Will stop that ship or die"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She stopped that ship, and they took its store
   <br/>
   She returned to Old Erin's shore
   <br/>
   With Spanish brandy she walked along
   <br/>
   Did Granuaile, did Granuaile
   <br/>
   Who sweetly sang a song
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Now Queen Elizabeth did once suggest
   <br/>
   That she would name Grace a countess
   <br/>
   "Oh no," says Grace, "That would never do
   <br/>
   For Grace O'Malley, for Grace O'Malley
   <br/>
   Is as great a queen as you"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The Queen of Connaught by land and sea
   <br/>
   Her strength commanded fierce loyalty
   <br/>
   Her wealth provided for many's the clans
   <br/>
   Of Grace O'Malley, of Grace O'Malley
   <br/>
   Seawoman of Ireland
  </p>
