  <p align="center">
   I am old, very old, but I don't need a wattle
   <br/>
   I am old, yes, I'm old, but I'm not a dry nettle
   <br/>
   All I need is man who is high in his mettle
   <br/>
   Glory oh glory, glory, when the evening declines
   <br/>
   Glory oh glory, glory, as the evening declines
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And before the black hunger, I'd husbands in plenty
   <br/>
   Maybe your granddad was one of the many
   <br/>
   Or was he that red-coat who swigged more than any?
   <br/>
   Glory oh glory, glory, when the evening declines
   <br/>
   Glory oh glory, glory, as the evening declines
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You can have all your gold, the high king of all metals
   <br/>
   With soft talk and kisses we'll never want better
   <br/>
   And the west of a ditch is the best of all settles
   <br/>
   Glory oh glory, glory, when the evening declines
   <br/>
   Glory oh glory, glory, as the evening declines
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I am old, very old, but I don't need a wattle
   <br/>
   I am old, yes, I'm old, but I'm not a dry nettle
   <br/>
   So you clout the pot, and I'll clout the kettle
   <br/>
   Glory oh glory, glory, when the evening declines
   <br/>
   Glory oh glory, glory, as the evening declines
  </p>
