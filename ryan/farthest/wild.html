  <p align="center">
   'Twas the wild flowers I preferred
   <br/>
   Who owed nothing to nobody
   <br/>
   But blossomed in the ditches
   <br/>
   And made their own way in the world
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   'Twas the wild flowers I admired
   <br/>
   Who never done nothing to you
   <br/>
   But driven from the garden
   <br/>
   Sang their own songs in the spring
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You can have your lily, you can have your rose
   <br/>
   That were taken and broken and bred by men
   <br/>
   They were grafted and lamed
   <br/>
   Twisted and tamed
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But the wild flowers I enjoyed
   <br/>
   They had nothing to do with you
   <br/>
   They flowered by the roadside
   <br/>
   And wore their own colors in the sun
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   That were there before you, will be there after you
   <br/>
   That will out, that will out like your own true nature
   <br/>
   You can try, you can try
   <br/>
   That you will never defeat
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The wild flowers I enjoyed
   <br/>
   They had nothing to do with you
   <br/>
   Banished from the garden
   <br/>
   They made their own way in the world
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   They sang their own songs in the spring
   <br/>
   And wore their own colors in the sun
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
