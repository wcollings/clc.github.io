  <p align="center">
   'Mid pleasures and palaces though we may roam
   <br/>
   Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home
   <br/>
   A charm from the skies seems to hallow us there
   <br/>
   Which seek through the world, is ne'er met with elsewhere
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Home, sweet home, there's no place like home
   <br/>
   Home, sweet home, there's no place like home
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I gaze on the moon as I tread the drear wild
   <br/>
   And feel that my mother now thinks of her child
   <br/>
   As she looks on that moon from our own cottage door
   <br/>
   Through the woodbine whose fragrance will cheer me no more
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   An exile from home, splendor dazzles in vain
   <br/>
   Oh give me my lowly-thatched cottage again
   <br/>
   The birds singing gaily that came at my call
   <br/>
   Give me them and that peace of mind, dearer than all
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Home, sweet home, there's no place like home
   <br/>
   Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
