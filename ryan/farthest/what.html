  <p align="center">
   What will you do, love, when I am going
   <br/>
   With white sails flowing, the seas beyond?
   <br/>
   What will you do, love, when waves divide us
   <br/>
   And friends may chide us for being fond?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Though waves divide us, and friends be chiding
   <br/>
   In faith abiding I'll still be true
   <br/>
   And I'll pray for you on the stormy ocean
   <br/>
   In deep devotion, that's what I'll do
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   What would you do, love, if distant tidings
   <br/>
   Your fond confidings should undermine?
   <br/>
   And I, abiding 'neath sultry skies
   <br/>
   Should think other eyes were as bright as thine?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh say it not, though guilt and shame
   <br/>
   Were on your name, I would still be true
   <br/>
   But that heart of yours, should another share it
   <br/>
   I could not bear it, what would I do?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   What would you do, love, when home returning
   <br/>
   With hopes high burning, with wealth for you
   <br/>
   If my barque which bounded o'er the foreign foam
   <br/>
   Should be lost near home? What would you do?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So you were spared, I'd bless the morrow
   <br/>
   In want and sorrow, that left me you
   <br/>
   And I'd welcome you from the wasting billow
   <br/>
   My heart, your pillow, that's what I'll do
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
