  <p align="center">
   My hope rests firm on Jesus Christ
   <br/>
   He is my only plea
   <br/>
   Though all the world should point and scorn
   <br/>
   His ransom leaves me free
   <br/>
   His ransom leaves me free
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   My hope sustains me as I strive
   <br/>
   And strain towards the goal
   <br/>
   Though still I stumble into sin
   <br/>
   His death paid for it all
   <br/>
   His death paid for it all
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   My hope provides me with a spur
   <br/>
   To help me run this race
   <br/>
   I know my tears will turn to joy
   <br/>
   The day I see His face
   <br/>
   The day I see His face
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   My hope is to be with my Lord
   <br/>
   To know as I am known
   <br/>
   To serve Him gladly all my days
   <br/>
   In praise before His throne
   <br/>
   In praise before His throne
  </p>
