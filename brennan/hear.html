  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Hear all creation lift its voice
   <br/>
   Hear mountains sing and rivers rejoice
   <br/>
   For the name of Jesus, for His name
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And we His people saved by grace
   <br/>
   We bow our hearts and we bring our praise
   <br/>
   To the sweet redeemer, for His name
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   So with everything we are
   <br/>
   And everything we have
   <br/>
   We pour out our offerings
   <br/>
   And if ever we should fail
   <br/>
   The rocks will rise up
   <br/>
   And crown Him the King of Kings
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He mends our hearts, He keeps our ways
   <br/>
   He lights our nights and He leads our days
   <br/>
   All for His glory, for His name
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There's nothing greater than to be His
   <br/>
   To bring Him glory and to fully live
   <br/>
   For the name of Jesus, for His name
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus 3x)
  </p>
