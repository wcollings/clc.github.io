  <p align="center">
   Did you see the sign of my love?
   <br/>
   Did you see the look in my eyes?
   <br/>
   Did you feel the touch of my hand
   <br/>
   Close to you?
   <br/>
   Do you feel my heart in your heart
   <br/>
   Forever?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Dream on of a love that's yours forever
   <br/>
   Hold on, take heart and discover all the world
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Could it be the waves on the rocks?
   <br/>
   Could it be the patter of the rain?
   <br/>
   Could it be the sigh of the breeze
   <br/>
   We didn't hear?
   <br/>
   Could it be the thrill of our love
   <br/>
   We felt come near?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Dream on of a love that's ours together
   <br/>
   Hold on with promise and discover all the world
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Would I have to dream on someday?
   <br/>
   Would I have a reason to stay?
   <br/>
   Would I have to look far away
   <br/>
   To find you?
   <br/>
   Would I have to dream on today
   <br/>
   To find a way?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Why did I say that I'm not the kind?
   <br/>
   Why did I feel that I'm left behind?
   <br/>
   Why did I think that I'll never fall
   <br/>
   In love again?
   <br/>
   Now you see I've changed my mind
   <br/>
   To love again
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Now I know to dream on today
   <br/>
   Now I know the reason to stay
   <br/>
   Now I know you're not far away
   <br/>
   My sweetheart
   <br/>
   Now I know we'll dream on some day
   <br/>
   Together
  </p>
