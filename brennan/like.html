   </b>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Like the starlight of crystal holding sweet wine
   <br/>
   Like the laugh of a child when he knows it's hometime
   <br/>
   Like the river that dances to the heart of the sea
   <br/>
   Is Your song to me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Like the willows that whisper in the breeze of the night
   <br/>
   Like the sound of a baby breathing softly at night
   <br/>
   Like the wild sleepy sun slipping into the sea
   <br/>
   Is Your song to me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Like the wild sleepy sun slipping into the sea
   <br/>
   Is Your song to me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Like the touch of a friend when I feel so unclean
   <br/>
   Like the guest at a banquet despite where I've been
   <br/>
   Like a love that's so rich and deeper than the sea
   <br/>
   Is Your song to me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Like a love that's so rich and deeper than the sea
   <br/>
   Is Your song to me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Your song calls to the light in the dark of the night
   <br/>
   Your song bleeds through a life that cuts death like a knife
   <br/>
   Your song breaks through the madness we play
   <br/>
   And blows it all away
   <br/>
   I want to sing Your song
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Like the starlight of crystal holding sweet wine
   <br/>
   Like the laugh of a child when he knows it's hometime
   <br/>
   Like a love that's so rich and deeper than the sea
   <br/>
   Is Your song to me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Like a love that's so rich and deeper than the sea
   <br/>
   Is Your song to me
  </p>
