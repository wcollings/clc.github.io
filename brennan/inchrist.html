  <p align="center">
   In Christ alone my heart is found
   <br/>
   He is my light, my strength, my song
   <br/>
   This cornerstone, this solid ground
   <br/>
   Firm through the fiercest drought and storm
   <br/>
   What heights of love, what depths of peace
   <br/>
   When fears are stilled, when strivings cease
   <br/>
   My comforter, my all in all
   <br/>
   Here in the love of Christ I stand
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   In Christ alone, who took on flesh
   <br/>
   Fullness of God in helpless babe
   <br/>
   This gift of love and righteousness
   <br/>
   Scorned by the ones He came to save
   <br/>
   'Til on that cross as Jesus died
   <br/>
   The wrath of God was satisfied
   <br/>
   For every sin on Him was laid
   <br/>
   Here in the death of Christ I live
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There in the ground His body lay
   <br/>
   Light of the world by darkness slain
   <br/>
   Then bursting forth in glorious day
   <br/>
   Up from the grave He rose again
   <br/>
   And as He stands in victory
   <br/>
   Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
   <br/>
   For I am His and He is mine
   <br/>
   Bought with the precious blood of Christ
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   No guilt in life, no fear in death
   <br/>
   This is the power of Christ in me
   <br/>
   From life's first cry to final death
   <br/>
   Jesus commands my destiny
   <br/>
   No power of hell, no scheme of man
   <br/>
   Can ever pluck me from His hand
   <br/>
   'Til He returns or calls me home
   <br/>
   Here in the power of Christ I'll stand
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   No power of hell, no scheme of man
   <br/>
   Can ever pluck me from His hand
   <br/>
   'Til He returns or calls me home
   <br/>
   Here in the power of Christ I'll stand
  </p>
