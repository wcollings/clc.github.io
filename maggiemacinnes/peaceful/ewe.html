   "Will you go to the ewe-bughts, Marian
   <br/>
   And wear in the sheep wi' me?
   <br/>
   The mavis sings sweetly, my Marian
   <br/>
   But not sae sweetly as thee"
   <br/>
   These aft were the words of my Sandy
   <br/>
   As we met in the howe of the glen
   <br/>
   But nae mair shall I meet wi' my Sandy
   <br/>
   For Sandy to Flanders is gane
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   How can the trumpet's loud clarion
   <br/>
   Thus take a' the shepherds afar?
   <br/>
   Oh could na' the ewe-bughts and Marian
   <br/>
   Please mair than the horrors of war?
   <br/>
   But, oh 'tis the fault o' them a', sirs
   <br/>
   In search of gowd and of fame
   <br/>
   The lads daily wander awa', sirs
   <br/>
   And leave their poor lasses at hame
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Not a plow in the land has been ganging
   <br/>
   The owsen hae stood in the sta'
   <br/>
   Nae flails in our barns hae been banging
   <br/>
   For mair than this towmond or twa
   <br/>
   Ilka Laird in the Highlands is rueing
   <br/>
   That he drove his poor tenants away
   <br/>
   For naething is seen here but ruin
   <br/>
   As the haughs are a' lying in lay
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There's gowd in the garters of Sandy
   <br/>
   And silk in his blue-bonnet lug
   <br/>
   And I'm not a kaerd nor a randy
   <br/>
   Nor a lass without blanket or rug
   <br/>
   Then why should he fight sae for riches
   <br/>
   Or seek for a sodger's degree
   <br/>
   Or fling by his kilt for the breeches
   <br/>
   And leave the dear ewe-bughts and me?
   <br/>
   And leave the dear ewe-bughts and me?
