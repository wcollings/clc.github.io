  <p align="center">
   As I went a-walkin' one mornin' in May
   <br/>
   I saw lovely Annie a-makin' the hay
   <br/>
   And as she moved onwards, the grass on each side
   <br/>
   Through a gap in the bushes my Annie I spied
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I went to the Highlands to work by the day
   <br/>
   But when I returned she was married away
   <br/>
   Though she swore to be constant, both loyal and true
   <br/>
   But now she's gone and left me, oh what will I do?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Far better transported, far better for I
   <br/>
   For my mind turns to madness since my Annie's away
   <br/>
   For she was my first and false true love, my treasure, my store
   <br/>
   Oh Annie, lovely Annie, will I ne'er see you more?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Some people, they tell me love has me led blind
   <br/>
   My master, he says he will have me confined
   <br/>
   That he'll send me to Bedlam, bind me in strong chains
   <br/>
   For your sake, lovely Annie, I suffer those pains
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Come, all you stout heroes, take a warnin' in time
   <br/>
   And never trust a red rose or a lily in prime
   <br/>
   For the green leaves will wither and the branches decay
   <br/>
   And the roots, they will torment you when the flowers fade away
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
