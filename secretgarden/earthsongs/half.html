  <p align="center">
   You're half a world away
   <br/>
   Standing next to me
   <br/>
   It seems that everyday
   <br/>
   I'm losing you almost invisibly
   <br/>
   Though you are near
   <br/>
   I can't reach that far
   <br/>
   Across to where you are
   <br/>
   And so you stay
   <br/>
   Just half a world away
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And I would cross the universe for you
   <br/>
   What good would it do if you weren't even there?
   <br/>
   'Til you return, until your way is clear
   <br/>
   I will be here, not half a world away
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You're half a world away
   <br/>
   And no one is to blame
   <br/>
   If love outlives its day
   <br/>
   And turns into an ember from a flame
   <br/>
   I love you as before
   <br/>
   'Til worlds will be no more
   <br/>
   'Til I can find a way
   <br/>
   To where you stay
   <br/>
   Just half a world away
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And I would cross the universe for you
   <br/>
   What good would it do if you weren't even there?
   <br/>
   'Til you return, until your way is clear
   <br/>
   I will be here, not half a world away
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You're half a world away
  </p>
