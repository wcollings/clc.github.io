  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When I'm less than I should be
   <br/>
   And I just can't face the day
   <br/>
   When darkness falls around me
   <br/>
   And I just can't find my way
   <br/>
   When my eyes don't clearly see
   <br/>
   And I stumble through it all
   <br/>
   You I lean upon, you keep me strong
   <br/>
   And you rise me when I fall
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   You are there when I most need you
   <br/>
   You are there so constantly
   <br/>
   You come shining through, you always do
   <br/>
   You are always there for me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When life brings me to my knees
   <br/>
   When my back's against the wall
   <br/>
   You are standing there right with me
   <br/>
   Just to keep me standing tall
   <br/>
   Though a burden I may be
   <br/>
   You don't weary, you don't rest
   <br/>
   You are reaching out to carry me
   <br/>
   And I know I'm heaven-blessed
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus 2x)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There when I most need you
   <br/>
   There so constantly
   <br/>
   You come shining through, you always do
   <br/>
   You are always there for me
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
