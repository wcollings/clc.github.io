  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I remember a meadow one morning in May
   <br/>
   With a sky full of dreams that sailed in that day
   <br/>
   I was dancing through green waves of grass like the sea
   <br/>
   And for a moment in time I could feel I was free
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There are waves of forgiveness and waves of regret
   <br/>
   And the first waves of true love I'll never forget
   <br/>
   In the meadow that morning as I wandered alone
   <br/>
   There were green waves of yearning for life still unknown
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Take me home to the meadow that cradles my heart
   <br/>
   Where the waves reach as far as you can see
   <br/>
   Take me home to the meadow, we've been too long apart
   <br/>
   I can still hear you calling for me
   <br/>
   (2x)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   What I'd give to remember that heavenly state
   <br/>
   Just a moment in time all mine to create
   <br/>
   As I'm taking my last breath I know what I will see
   <br/>
   There'll be green waves forever out there waiting for me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Take me home to the meadow that cradles my heart
   <br/>
   Where the waves reach as far as you can see
   <br/>
   Take me home to the meadow, we've been too long apart
   <br/>
   I can still hear you calling for me
  </p>
