  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I'm driving through the open roads of hometown
   <br/>
   The junipers are swaying again
   <br/>
   It's barely five o'clock and sunlight's on the loch
   <br/>
   And nothing's wrong, no, nothing's wrong
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I've been working day and night for this moment
   <br/>
   Since I shed those leaves of doubt
   <br/>
   It's here I want to stay, in the early morning gray
   <br/>
   And I can't change, no, I can't change
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   No more running at the moon in all her splendor
   <br/>
   Her faces haunted me
   <br/>
   I'm staying where the days will seem much longer
   <br/>
   In the early morning gray
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There's something in this season, so golden
   <br/>
   Something in the lay of this land
   <br/>
   If only you and me were the child I can see
   <br/>
   We'd be all right
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I'm standing on the fringe of the ocean
   <br/>
   The century is closing at last
   <br/>
   It's here I want to stay, in the early morning gray
   <br/>
   And I can't change, no, I can't change
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   In the early morning gray...
  </p>
