  <p align="center">
   I will not wear the willow
   <br/>
   Though my love is gone
   <br/>
   There's a cool corner of the pillow
   <br/>
   I will lay my head on
   <br/>
   I will lay my head on
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I will not grieve in sorrow
   <br/>
   For what has come to pass
   <br/>
   Turn my thoughts to tomorrow
   <br/>
   I will not cast the glass
   <br/>
   I will not cast the glass
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And I will not tremble
   <br/>
   With the women in black
   <br/>
   He's gone to the devil
   <br/>
   And he won't be coming back
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Some said he took the shilling
   <br/>
   Some said he took to the sea
   <br/>
   Some said there once was a killing
   <br/>
   And the killer was he
   <br/>
   And the killer was he
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I will not wear the willow
   <br/>
   I will not lower my eyes
   <br/>
   Though it's not on my pillow
   <br/>
   I know where he lies
   <br/>
   I know where he lies
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And I will not tremble
   <br/>
   With the women in black
   <br/>
   He's gone to the devil
   <br/>
   And he won't be, he won't be coming back
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He won't be coming back...
  </p>
