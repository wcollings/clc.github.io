  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Hearts are meant to be broken, made that way
   <br/>
   Love must have its trial
   <br/>
   Beauty, hope and wonder could not be
   <br/>
   Without doubt and pain and self-denial
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   All the flowers of the bough
   <br/>
   They will fall and they will fade
   <br/>
   But they resound in the distance of the days
   <br/>
   Is life just a dance of happenstance?
   <br/>
   I don't believe that
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The wheel of the sky is rolling away from you
   <br/>
   You can feel it fall
   <br/>
   And it's not always easy, but if you try
   <br/>
   You might see the genius of it all
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   If I could give you one thing
   <br/>
   If there could be just one thing
   <br/>
   I, I would give you dreams
   <br/>
   We've got to realize we're only passersby
   <br/>
   But you see, dreams survive all life's uncertainties
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I don't believe that...
  </p>
