   There's a morning
   <br/>
   A gentle light that blows out of the sky
   <br/>
   And you realize
   <br/>
   It's like no other morning
   <br/>
   You wipe the sleep out of your eyes
   <br/>
   And you wonder why
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   All the clouds of yesterday
   <br/>
   Have flit the skies and blown away
   <br/>
   And someone's calling your name
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There's a morning
   <br/>
   You lie awake, you're waiting for the rain
   <br/>
   But it does not appear
   <br/>
   And you have your dreams
   <br/>
   You understand what money means
   <br/>
   Nothing here
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   All the clouds of yesterday
   <br/>
   Have flit the skies and blown away
   <br/>
   And someone's calling your name
   <br/>
   Are you coming out to play?
   <br/>
   Are you coming out to play?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There's a morning
   <br/>
   You doubted you would ever see this day
   <br/>
   But you had faith
   <br/>
   Faith is the distance
   <br/>
   From what you hope to what you fear
   <br/>
   It's brought you here
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   All the clouds of yesterday
   <br/>
   Have flit the skies and blown away
   <br/>
   (3x)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And someone's calling your name
   <br/>
   Are you coming out to play?...
  </p>
