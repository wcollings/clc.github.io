   I was hiding in the light
   <br/>
   And I failed to see your love
   <br/>
   All my moments made of stone
   <br/>
   All my angels made of words
   <br/>
   All my angels made of words
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I was waiting for your smile
   <br/>
   Like time was on my side I said
   <br/>
   It's not me you're looking for
   <br/>
   There's no case for going there
   <br/>
   With your down and perfect heart
   <br/>
   With your down and perfect heart
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I was waiting for your smile
   <br/>
   Like time was on my side I said
   <br/>
   My whispered reason is
   <br/>
   The darkness of your kiss
  </p>
