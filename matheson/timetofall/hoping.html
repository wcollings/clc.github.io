  <p align="center">
   Desire is in ashes, careless soul
   <br/>
   Free to go
   <br/>
   Free to go, babe
   <br/>
   Like it's something heartfelt
   <br/>
   Like it's end of show
   <br/>
   Like it's end of show, babe
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You just wanted a better world
   <br/>
   I was just hoping, I was just hoping
   <br/>
   You just wanted something new
   <br/>
   I was just hoping for you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We could waltz right back
   <br/>
   To the way we intended
   <br/>
   We could fall for a moment
   <br/>
   Like lovers are meant to
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You just wanted a better world
   <br/>
   I was just hoping, I was just hoping
   <br/>
   You just wanted something new
   <br/>
   I was just hoping for you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You just wanted something new
   <br/>
   You just wanted something new
   <br/>
   I was just hoping for you...
