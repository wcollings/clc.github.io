  <p align="center">
   There was a lass an she was fair at kirk an' market tae be seen
   <br/>
   When aw oor fairest maids were met, the flower o' them, bonnie Jean
   <br/>
   Aye, she wrought her country work an she sang sae joyfully
   <br/>
   The bonniest bird upon the bush hae ne'er a lighter heart than she
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But hawks will rob the tender joys that bless the lint white nest
   <br/>
   Frost will blight the fairest flower, love will break the soundest rest
   <br/>
   For she met a braw young lad, the pride o'aw his glen
   <br/>
   And he had owsen, sheep and kye, an bonnie horses nine or ten
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The lad took Jeanie tae the tryst, danced the lassie on the down
   <br/>
   Lang ere witless, Jeannie wist her heart wis tint, her peace was stown
   <br/>
   As in the bosom o' the stream the moon dwells at dewy een
   <br/>
   So trembling pure was tender love within the breast o' bonnie Jean
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Monies a bird sang sweet o'love, flowers bloom ower the dale
   <br/>
   An close tae her he aft did lay and whispered this, his tender tale
   <br/>
   Oh Jeannie fair, I love thee dear an will ye gang wi me
   <br/>
   Aye, an leave your parent's hame, and nothing else will trouble thee
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So what could helpless Jeannie do?
   <br/>
   She had nae will tae say him naw
   <br/>
   At length she blushed a sweet consent
   <br/>
   And love was aye between them twa
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
