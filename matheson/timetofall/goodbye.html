  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You like to think that you're bad
   <br/>
   Because it lets you off the hook
   <br/>
   Your pride's in rags
   <br/>
   You do it by the book
   <br/>
   But because of and in spite of
   <br/>
   All the hapless things you do
   <br/>
   I see the good in you
   <br/>
   I see the good in you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   What you can't control
   <br/>
   You say you have to curse
   <br/>
   You're on another planet
   <br/>
   In another universe
   <br/>
   Now it's crystal clear
   <br/>
   You don't want anybody to
   <br/>
   I see the good in you
   <br/>
   I see the good in you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You can't let go unless you fall apart
   <br/>
   And you won't betray your art
   <br/>
   But in the darkness
   <br/>
   You are innocent
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Last night I dreamt about you
   <br/>
   In the back of a black mariah
   <br/>
   You were screaming for justice
   <br/>
   And calling everyone a liar
   <br/>
   On your crown of thorns
   <br/>
   Wild roses grew
   <br/>
   I see the good in you
   <br/>
   I see the good in you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I see the good in you
   <br/>
   I see the good in you
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
