  <p align="center">
   News has just broken
   <br/>
   It's out in the open
   <br/>
   It's happening every day
   <br/>
   Someone is lost
   <br/>
   Someone is found
   <br/>
   Something is learned on the way
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The words fly around
   <br/>
   And I've heard them before
   <br/>
   But it's new and it's real this time
   <br/>
   Give me the strength
   <br/>
   To say what is right
   <br/>
   Or we'll fall
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus (after each verse)
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Only you, only you
   <br/>
   Can make it real for me
   <br/>
   How can I, how can I
   <br/>
   Make it real for you?
   <br/>
   I will give what I can
   <br/>
   And take what I find
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   People have said
   <br/>
   That love is a game
   <br/>
   But the rules have never been clear
   <br/>
   There's love and there's loss
   <br/>
   And you know you're alive
   <br/>
   When you feel it again and again
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And the shadows fall away
   <br/>
   From the room inside your heart
   <br/>
   Take a step and you will see
   <br/>
   An eternity
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   What I find
  </p>
 </body>
