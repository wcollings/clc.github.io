  <p align="center">
   Come, all ye lads so fiery now
   <br/>
   That would hear of a fair young maiden
   <br/>
   And she looked out on a summer's day
   <br/>
   For to view the soldiers parading
   <br/>
   They marched so bold and they looked so gay
   <br/>
   With the colors flying and the bands did play
   <br/>
   And it caused young Mary for to say
   <br/>
   "I'll wed you, me gallant soldier"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, she viewed the soldiers on parade
   <br/>
   And as they stood at their leisure
   <br/>
   And Mary to herself did say
   <br/>
   "At last I've found my treasure
   <br/>
   But oh how cruel me parents must be
   <br/>
   To banish me darlin' so far from me
   <br/>
   Well, I'll leave them all and I'll go with thee
   <br/>
   Me bold, undaunted soldier"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh Mary dear, your parents love
   <br/>
   I pray don't be unruly
   <br/>
   For when you're in a foreign land
   <br/>
   Believe me, you'll rue it surely
   <br/>
   Perhaps in battle I might fall
   <br/>
   From a shot, from an angry cannon ball
   <br/>
   And you so far from your daddy's hall
   <br/>
   Be advised by a gallant soldier
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And I have fifty guineas in bright gold
   <br/>
   Likewise a heart that's burning
   <br/>
   And I'll leave them all and I'll go with you
   <br/>
   Me bold undaunted soldier
   <br/>
   So don't say no, but let me go
   <br/>
   And I will face each daring foe
   <br/>
   And we'll march together to and fro
   <br/>
   And I'll wed you, me gallant soldier
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When he saw her loyalty
   <br/>
   And Mary so true hearted
   <br/>
   He said, "Me darlin', married we'll be
   <br/>
   And nothing but death will part us
   <br/>
   And when we're in a foreign land
   <br/>
   I'll guard you, darlin', with my right hand
   <br/>
   And I hope that God might stand a friend
   <br/>
   To Mary and her gallant soldier"
