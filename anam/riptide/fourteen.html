  <p align="center">
   Fourteen days now I have been running
   <br/>
   From a prison far from here
   <br/>
   To my lover I must go now
   <br/>
   To live without her I cannot bear
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I was a poor man in search of labor
   <br/>
   The days had ended down in the mines
   <br/>
   For stealing silver I was imprisoned
   <br/>
   There was no work here to be found
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I robbed a rich man of his purse of money
   <br/>
   To pay the rent to feed a poor mouth
   <br/>
   I was trembling as I drew the dagger
   <br/>
   Oh my God, what have I done?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   They caught and bound me, mocked and scorned me
   <br/>
   And said my true love I'd see no more
   <br/>
   Into the darkness I did stumble
   <br/>
   But I escaped from that den of woe
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Now I must find her, ma belle Louise
   <br/>
   If you should see her, say this for me
   <br/>
   "Please forgive me, and when I find you
   <br/>
   I'll take you far away from here"
  </p>

  </cleaned>
