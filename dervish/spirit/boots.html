  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I'm sailing away, my own true love
   <br/>
   Sailing away in the morning
   <br/>
   Is there something I can send you from across the sea
   <br/>
   From the place where I'll be landing?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There's nothing you can send me, my own true love
   <br/>
   There's nothing that I wish to be owning
   <br/>
   Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
   <br/>
   From across the lonesome ocean
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But I just thought you might want something fine
   <br/>
   Made of silver or of golden
   <br/>
   Either from the mountains of Madrid
   <br/>
   Or the coast of Barcelona
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But if I had the stars from the darkest nights
   <br/>
   Or the diamonds from the deepest ocean
   <br/>
   I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
   <br/>
   For that's all I'm wishing to be owning
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   That I might be gone a long time
   <br/>
   And it's only that I'm asking
   <br/>
   Is there something I can send you to remember me by
   <br/>
   To make your time more easy passing?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh how can you, how can you ask me again
   <br/>
   When you know it brings me sorrow?
   <br/>
   The same thing that I will want today
   <br/>
   I will want again tomorrow
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh I got a letter on a lonesome day
   <br/>
   It was from his ship a-sailing
   <br/>
   Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again
   <br/>
   It depends on how I'm feeling"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, if you, my love, must think that way
   <br/>
   I'm sure your mind is roaming
   <br/>
   I'm sure your heart is not with me
   <br/>
   But with the country to where you're going
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So take heed, take heed of the western wind
   <br/>
   Take heed of the stormy weather
   <br/>
   Yes, there is something you can bring back to me
   <br/>
   Spanish boots of Spanish leather
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
