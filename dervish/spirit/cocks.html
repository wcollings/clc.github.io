  <p align="center">
   The cocks are crowing, daylight is appearing
   <br/>
   It's drawing nigh to the break of day
   <br/>
   Arise, my darling, out of your slumber
   <br/>
   Arise, my darling, and let me in
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And when he came to his true love's window
   <br/>
   He kneeled low down upon a stone
   <br/>
   And through the window he whispered softly
   <br/>
   "Arise, my darling, and let me in"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Well, who is that that is at my window?
   <br/>
   And who is that that gives me no rest?"
   <br/>
   "'Tis I, 'tis I a poor wounded lover
   <br/>
   Who fain would speak with you, love, awhile"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Then go away, love, and ask your daddy
   <br/>
   If he would have you my bride to be
   <br/>
   But if he says no then return and tell me
   <br/>
   For this is the last time I will trouble thee"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Oh my dada is in his bed chamber
   <br/>
   He's fast asleep on his bed of ease
   <br/>
   But in his pocket there lies a letter
   <br/>
   Which reads far, love, on to your disgrace"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Oh what disgrace can he do unto me?
   <br/>
   A faithful husband to you I'll be
   <br/>
   And what other neighbours have 'round their houses
   <br/>
   The same, my darling, you would have with me"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Then go away, love, and ask your mammy
   <br/>
   If she would have you my bride to be
   <br/>
   But if she says no then return and tell me
   <br/>
   For this is the last time I will trouble thee"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Oh my mama, she's an old aged woman
   <br/>
   And scarce can hear, love, one word I say
   <br/>
   But she'd have you go, love, and court some other
   <br/>
   For I'm not a fitting girl your bride to be"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "I'll go away but I'll court no other
   <br/>
   My heart is linked all on your charms
   <br/>
   I'd have you go, love, and leave your mammy
   <br/>
   For you're only fit to lie in your love's arms"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "I'll go away unto the wild mountains
   <br/>
   Where I'll see nothing but the wild deer
   <br/>
   And I'll eat nothing but the wild herbs sure
   <br/>
   I'll drink nothing but my true love's tears"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "And if the Kellybawn, it were mine in the chorus
   <br/>
   And the green fields, they were mine and wide
   <br/>
   If my pen was made of the tempered steel sure
   <br/>
   My true love's praises I could never write"
  </p>
