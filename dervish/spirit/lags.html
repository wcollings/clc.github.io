  <p align="center">
   When I was a young man
   <br/>
   Sometimes I'd wonder
   <br/>
   What happened to time when it passed
   <br/>
   Then one day I found out
   <br/>
   That time just lands in prison
   <br/>
   And there it is held fast
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When I was a young man
   <br/>
   I used to go courting
   <br/>
   Underneath the moon and the stars
   <br/>
   The moon is still shining
   <br/>
   But the dreams, they are all broken
   <br/>
   On these hard iron bars
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Look out of the window
   <br/>
   Over the rooftops
   <br/>
   Over the wall, up to the sky
   <br/>
   Just one flying leap
   <br/>
   And you could make your getaway
   <br/>
   If only you could fly
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The prison is sleeping
   <br/>
   And the nightwatch is keeping
   <br/>
   His watch over seven hundred men
   <br/>
   And behind every cell door
   <br/>
   A sleeping lad lies dreaming
   <br/>
   Oh to be free again
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When I was a young man
   <br/>
   Sometimes I'd wonder
   <br/>
   What happened to time when it passed
   <br/>
   Then one day I found out
   <br/>
   That time just lands in prison
   <br/>
   And there it is held fast
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Held fast
  </p>
