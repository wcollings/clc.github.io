  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I once was a maid but I cannot tell when
   <br/>
   Still my delight is in proper young men
   <br/>
   Some one of a troop of dragoons was my daddy
   <br/>
   No wonder I fell for a young soldier laddie
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The first of my loves was a swaggering blade
   <br/>
   To rattle the thundering drum was his trade
   <br/>
   His leg was so tight and his cheek was so ruddy
   <br/>
   Transported was I with my young soldier laddie
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But the godly old chaplin left him in the lurch
   <br/>
   And the gun I forsook for the sake of the church
   <br/>
   He ventured the soul and I risked the body
   <br/>
   'Twas then I proved false to my young soldier laddie
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Full soon I grew sick of my sanctified thoughts
   <br/>
   To the regiment at large for a husband I sought
   <br/>
   From the gilded spitoon to the fife I was ready
   <br/>
   And I asked for no more than a young soldier laddie
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But the peace it reduced me to beg in despair
   <br/>
   'Til I met my old laddie at Canningham Fair
   <br/>
   His rags regimental they fluttered so gaudy
   <br/>
   And my heart did rejoice in my young soldier laddie
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Now I have lived for I know not how long
   <br/>
   And still I can join in a cup or a song
   <br/>
   And while with both hands I can hold the glass steady
   <br/>
   Here's to you, my love, my young soldier laddie
  </p>
