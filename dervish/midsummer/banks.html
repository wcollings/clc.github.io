  <p align="center">
   Well met, well met, my own true love
   <br/>
   Well met, my love, by thee
   <br/>
   I've just arrived from the salt, salt sea
   <br/>
   And it's all for the love of thee
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Now I could have married a great king's daughter
   <br/>
   And have myself to blame
   <br/>
   And it's tons of gold I have refused
   <br/>
   And it's all for the love of you, my love
   <br/>
   All for the love of you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, if you could have married a great king's daughter
   <br/>
   You have yourself to blame
   <br/>
   Well, I have married my house-carpenter
   <br/>
   And I think he's a nice young man
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, if you do leave you house-carpenter
   <br/>
   And come along with me
   <br/>
   I'll take you to where the grass grows green
   <br/>
   On the banks of the Sweet Viledee, my love
   <br/>
   Banks of the Sweet Viledee
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   If I was to leave my house-carpenter
   <br/>
   And go along with thee
   <br/>
   What have you there to support me with
   <br/>
   And keep me from slavery?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, I have six ships now sailing out
   <br/>
   And seven more on sea
   <br/>
   Three hundred and ten all jolly sailsmen
   <br/>
   All to wait on thee, my love
   <br/>
   All for to wait on thee
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She dressed her baby all neat and clean
   <br/>
   And gave him kisses three
   <br/>
   Saying, "Stay, stay here, my darling baby boy
   <br/>
   With you father for company"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She dressed herself in a suit of red
   <br/>
   And her maiden waist was green
   <br/>
   And every town they passed by
   <br/>
   They took her to be some queen, my love
   <br/>
   Took her to be some queen
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   They were not two days out at sea
   <br/>
   And I'm sure they were not three
   <br/>
   When this fair maid began to weep
   <br/>
   And she wept most bitterly
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   My curse, my curse, and all sailsmen
   <br/>
   Who brought me out on sea
   <br/>
   And deprived me of my house-carpenter
   <br/>
   On the banks of the Sweet Viledee, my love
   <br/>
   Banks of the Sweet Viledee
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   They were not three days out at sea
   <br/>
   And I'm sure they were not four
   <br/>
   When this fair maid disappeared from the deck
   <br/>
   And she sank to rise no more, my love
   <br/>
   Sank to rise no more
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
