  </p>
  <p align="center">
   As I was going to the fair of Dingle
   <br/>
   One fine morning last July
   <br/>
   A fine young man came up behind me
   <br/>
   "Red-haired Mary," did he cry
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Will you come with me, my red-haired Mary?
   <br/>
   The donkey, he can carry two"
   <br/>
   I looked at him, me eyes did twinkle
   <br/>
   Me cheeks, they were a rosy hue
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Thank you kindly, sir," I answered
   <br/>
   Then tossed me light red hair
   <br/>
   Says I, "Will you hold the donkey
   <br/>
   And I'll ride with you to the Dingle fair"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When we reached the town of Dingle
   <br/>
   He caught me hand to say good-bye
   <br/>
   Hit him in his left eye
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Take your hands off red-haired Mary
   <br/>
   She and I are to be wed
   <br/>
   We were with the priest this very morn
   <br/>
   Tonight we'll lie in our marriage bed
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, he was feeling very peevish
   <br/>
   His poor eye was sad and sore
   <br/>
   He kicked the tinker with his hobnails
   <br/>
   Knocked him through Tom Murphy's door
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He galloped off to meet his father
   <br/>
   The tallest man you e'er did see
   <br/>
   He tapped him gently with his knuckles
   <br/>
   And now he's missing two front teeth
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh and I, the happy cailin
   <br/>
   "Man, with you I'll go," I said
   <br/>
   "Never mind the priest this very morn
   <br/>
   Tonight we'll sleep in Murphy's shed"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Around the corner came a peeler
   <br/>
   Told him I had broke the law
   <br/>
   The donkey kicked him on the kneecap
   <br/>
   He fell down and broke his jaw
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Through the fair we roamed together
   <br/>
   His black eye and my red hair
   <br/>
   Gazing gaily at the tinker
   <br/>
   Weren't we the happy pair?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus 2x)
  </p>
 </body>
