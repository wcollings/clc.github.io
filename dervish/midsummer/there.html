  <p align="center">
   There was a maid in her father's garden
   <br/>
   And a gentleman, he came passing by
   <br/>
   He stood awhile to gaze upon her
   <br/>
   And he said, "Fair maid, would you fancy I?"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "But I'm not a lady, I'm a poor girl
   <br/>
   A poor man's daughter of low degree
   <br/>
   Therefore, young man, find some other sweetheart
   <br/>
   For your servant maid I'm not fit to be
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It's seven years since I had a true love
   <br/>
   Seven more since I did him see
   <br/>
   And seven more I will wait upon him
   <br/>
   But if he's alive, he'll come back to me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   If he's sick, I will wish him better
   <br/>
   If he's dead, I will wish him rest
   <br/>
   But if he's alive, I will wait upon him
   <br/>
   He's the only young man I do love best"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "It's seven years since you had a true love
   <br/>
   Seven more since you did him see
   <br/>
   And seven more you will wait upon him
   <br/>
   Perhaps that young man you ne'er will see"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He put a hand down in his pocket
   <br/>
   His gentle fingers, they were thin and small
   <br/>
   And up between them he pulled a gold ring
   <br/>
   And when she saw it, she down did fall
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He picked her up all in his arms
   <br/>
   And gave her kisses most tenderly
   <br/>
   Saying, "I'm your true love and single sailor
   <br/>
   Who came o'er the sea for to wed with thee"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "If you're my true love and single sailor
   <br/>
   Your gentle features, they look strange to me
   <br/>
   But seven years makes great alterations
   <br/>
   O'er the raging seas between you and me"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There was a maid in her father's garden
   <br/>
   And a gentleman, he came passing by
   <br/>
   He stood awhile to gaze upon her
   <br/>
   And he said, "Fair maid, would you fancy I?"
