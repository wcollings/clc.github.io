   Me name is Bold Doherty from the north country
   <br/>
   Where there's a still upon every stream
   <br/>
   Lady, be quicker and pour me more liquor
   <br/>
   And fill me a glass of the stronger than cream
   <br/>
   If I had you, Molly, so pleasant and jolly
   <br/>
   Although it's a folly to ask you at all
   <br/>
   I'd fill up me glass with a mile to the bottom
   <br/>
   And I'd drink to you, Molly, beside Donegal
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   With me fol the dol do, fol the dol do with me
   <br/>
   Fol the dol do with me, fol the dol day
   <br/>
   Fol the dol do, fol the dol do with me
   <br/>
   Fol the dol do with me, fol the dol day
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I've a new pair of clogs I brought home from the market
   <br/>
   I craved an excuse to get into the town
   <br/>
   I told me old mother the seams, they were ripped
   <br/>
   And I needed some nails for to rivet them down
   <br/>
   She clothed me hand with a bright bit of shilling
   <br/>
   She thought the remainder would be her own
   <br/>
   Saying, "When you go to town, you can buy the full nagan
   <br/>
   But beware you bring none of your fancibles home"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When crossing the fields of me brave Enniskillen
   <br/>
   I went into an ale-house for to take a dram
   <br/>
   When I saw two tinkers dividing a saucepan
   <br/>
   Although there were arguing about the ten can
   <br/>
   One of them then made a blow at the other one
   <br/>
   He said, "You young villain, I will take your life"
   <br/>
   Saying, "Your saucepans are leaking and won't hold the water
   <br/>
   Since 'ere the Bold Doherty spoke with your wife"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh when I got home, the door, it was bolted
   <br/>
   I rapped up me mother for to let me in
   <br/>
   "Be gone ore the place" was the words that she mentioned
   <br/>
   "For inside this house you'll not enter in
   <br/>
   You may go away to wherever you came from
   <br/>
   For to keep you out, now I'm sure it's no sin"
   <br/>
   Says I, "Me gay woman, you may keep your temper
   <br/>
   'Cause I can find lodging with Nora McGlynn"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus 2x)
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
