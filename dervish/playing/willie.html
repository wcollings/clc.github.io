    It was early one morning Willie Lennox arose
    <br/>
    And straight to his cousin's bed chamber he goes
    <br/>
    Saying, "Arise, lovely cousin, and let no one know
    <br/>
    'Tis a fine summer's morning, to the lakes let us go"
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    As Willie and his cousin when down the long lane
    <br/>
    They met Sargent Henry and Colonel Ronayne
    <br/>
    Said the Colonel, "Do not enter, do not venture in
    <br/>
    For there's deep and false waters in Lough Inshollin"
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    But Willie, being stout-hearted, it's in he did go
    <br/>
    He swam to an island which was his overthrow
    <br/>
    He swam it twice over and was turning around
    <br/>
    And in a few minutes Willie Lennox was drowned
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    Small boats, they were lowered, long lines were let down
    <br/>
    And in a few minutes Willie Lennox was found
    <br/>
    There was an old woman being there standing by
    <br/>
    She ran to his mother and this she did cry
    <br/>
    "Sad news I have for you which grieves my heart sore
    <br/>
    For your own darling Willie, his name is no more"
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    And as for Willie's true love who mourns night and day
    <br/>
    For the loss of her true love who lies cold in the clay
    <br/>
    For both morning and evening he did her salute
    <br/>
    With the pink and red roses and all garden fruit
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    All gathered together and stood in a ring
    <br/>
    While the orange and purple around them did hang
    <br/>
    They all whispered lowly and raised up their hands
    <br/>
    Saying, "Boys, while you're living, beware of the Bann"
   </font>
