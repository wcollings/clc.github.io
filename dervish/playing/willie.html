  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It was early one morning Willie Lennox arose
   <br/>
   And straight to his cousin's bed chamber he goes
   <br/>
   Saying, "Arise, lovely cousin, and let no one know
   <br/>
   'Tis a fine summer's morning, to the lakes let us go"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   As Willie and his cousin when down the long lane
   <br/>
   They met Sargent Henry and Colonel Ronayne
   <br/>
   Said the Colonel, "Do not enter, do not venture in
   <br/>
   For there's deep and false waters in Lough Inshollin"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But Willie, being stout-hearted, it's in he did go
   <br/>
   He swam to an island which was his overthrow
   <br/>
   He swam it twice over and was turning around
   <br/>
   And in a few minutes Willie Lennox was drowned
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Small boats, they were lowered, long lines were let down
   <br/>
   And in a few minutes Willie Lennox was found
   <br/>
   There was an old woman being there standing by
   <br/>
   She ran to his mother and this she did cry
   <br/>
   "Sad news I have for you which grieves my heart sore
   <br/>
   For your own darling Willie, his name is no more"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And as for Willie's true love who mourns night and day
   <br/>
   For the loss of her true love who lies cold in the clay
   <br/>
   For both morning and evening he did her salute
   <br/>
   With the pink and red roses and all garden fruit
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   All gathered together and stood in a ring
   <br/>
   While the orange and purple around them did hang
   <br/>
   They all whispered lowly and raised up their hands
   <br/>
   Saying, "Boys, while you're living, beware of the Bann"
  </p>
