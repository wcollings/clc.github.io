   Said Johnny to Molly, "I am now going to leave you
   <br/>
   But do not be grieved at my going away
   <br/>
   For the more we are parted, we'll always be true-hearted
   <br/>
   And again I'll return in the sweet month of May"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Said Molly to Johnny, "Oh I will mourn for you
   <br/>
   And I will be grieved at your going away
   <br/>
   For you know very well that your absence does grieve me
   <br/>
   I'm afraid you might die in a strange country
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I'll dress myself up like a neat little sea boy
   <br/>
   Amidst all life's dangers I will stand your friend
   <br/>
   Through the winds that lie low, to high winds are a-blowing
   <br/>
   My dear, I'll be with you to plow the rough main"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Your delicate fingers our ropes could not handle
   <br/>
   Your lily-white feet, love, our decks could not stand
   <br/>
   The cold nights of winter you ne'er could endure them
   <br/>
   So stay at home, darling, to the seas do not go"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Her two little arms, 'round his neck she entwined them
   <br/>
   The clear crystal tears from her eyes down did flow
   <br/>
   And her lily-white hands on the decks she kept wringing
   <br/>
   Crying, "Oh my beloved will I never see you more?"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So come, all ye fair maids that's inclined to marry
   <br/>
   Never place your affection too much on one man
   <br/>
   For first he will court you and then he'll deceive you
   <br/>
   He'll leave you as I was left to mourn when he's gone
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
