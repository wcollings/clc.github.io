  <p align="center">
   As I roved out on a summer's morning a-speculating most curiously
   <br/>
   To my surprise, I there espied a charming fair maid approaching me
   <br/>
   I stood awhile in deep meditation contemplating what I should do
   <br/>
   'Til at length recruiting all my sensations I thus accosted the Cailin Rua
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Are you Aurora or the goddess Flora, Artemidora or Venus bright?
   <br/>
   Or Helen, fair beyond compare, that Paris stole from the Grecian sight?
   <br/>
   Oh fairest maiden, you have enslaved me, I'm captivated in Cupid's clew
   <br/>
   Your golden sayings are infatuations that have enslaved me, a Cailin Rua
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Kind sir, be easy and do not tease me with your false praises so jestingly
   <br/>
   Your dissimulation and invocation are vaunting praises alluring me
   <br/>
   I am not Aurora or the goddess Flora, I'm a rural maid to all men's view
   <br/>
   Who's here condoling my situation, my appelation the Cailin Rua
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh were I Hector, that noble victor, who died a victim to Grecian skill
   <br/>
   Or were I Paris whose deeds are various, an arbitrator on Ida's Hill
   <br/>
   I'd rage through Asia like Abyssinia Pennsylvania seeking you
   <br/>
   The burning raygions like sage Orpheus to see your face, my sweet Cailin Rua
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
 </body>
