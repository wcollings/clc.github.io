  <p align="center">
   On a fine summer's morning our horns, they did blow
   <br/>
   To the green fields 'round Tassu where the huntsmen did go
   <br/>
   For to meet the bold sportsman from around Cady town
   <br/>
   And none loved that sport better than the boys from May-down
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh and when we arrived, they were all standing there
   <br/>
   So we took to the green fields in search of the hare
   <br/>
   We did not go far when someone gave cheer
   <br/>
   Over hills and high meadows the prey did appear
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When she got to the heather, she tried them to shun
   <br/>
   But our dogs never missed one inch where she'd run
   <br/>
   They kept well-packed when going over the hill
   <br/>
   For the hounds had set out this sweet hare for to kill
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   With our dogs all abreast and the big mountain hare
   <br/>
   And the sweet charming music, it rang through the air
   <br/>
   Straight for the black bank for to try them once more
   <br/>
   But it was her last sight 'round the Hills of Greenmore
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh and as we trailed on to where the hare, she did lie
   <br/>
   She sprang to her feet for to bid them good-bye
   <br/>
   Their music, it ceased, and a cry we could hear
   <br/>
   Saying, "Bad luck to the ones brought ye May-down dogs here
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Last night as I lay quite content in the glen
   <br/>
   It was little I thought of the dogs or the men
   <br/>
   But when going home at the clear break of day
   <br/>
   I could hear the loud horn young Toner did play
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Now that I'm dying and me sport, it is done
   <br/>
   No more through the green fields of Cady I'll run
   <br/>
   Nor feed in the glen on a cold winter's night
   <br/>
   Or go home to my den when it's breaking daylight
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I blame old McMahon for bringing Coyle here
   <br/>
   He's been at the same caper for many's the year
   <br/>
   Every Saturday and Sunday, he'd never give o'er
   <br/>
   With a pack of strange dogs 'round the Hills of Greenmore"
  </p>
