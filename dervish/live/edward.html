   The sun was setting behind the mountain
   <br/>
   The dew was falling upon the leaves
   <br/>
   As I was seated beside a fountain
   <br/>
   A feathered songster sang upon the trees
   <br/>
   With love and longing his notes were sounding
   <br/>
   Made me reminded of days of yore
   <br/>
   When by a bower I picked a flower
   <br/>
   And remembered Edmund by Lough Éirn's shore
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The cuckoo's notes on the air resounding
   <br/>
   All sound so pleasing to greet the ear
   <br/>
   And every note with peace abounding
   <br/>
   Around the valley if he were here
   <br/>
   Delight has fled me, and grief has wed me
   <br/>
   Why did you leave me, my love, a stór
   <br/>
   And every note reminds me of Edward
   <br/>
   And makes me lonely by Lough Éirn's shore
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh if I could move like a wind o'er the ocean
   <br/>
   I would send this sigh o'er the distant deep
   <br/>
   Or could I __ like a bird in motion
   <br/>
   By my Edward's side I would ever keep
   <br/>
   I'd gently soothe him, with words amuse him
   <br/>
   My love I'd prove him, and he'd sigh no more
   <br/>
   For seven years, they would soon would pass over
   <br/>
   And we'd both be happy by Lough Éirn's shore
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
