      There's a home by the wide Avonmore

      That will sweep o'er the broad open sea

      And wide rivers their waves wash ashore
      <br/>
      Whilst bulrushes wave to the breeze
      <br/>
      Where the green ivy clings 'round the door

      And I pray for my own cailín bán
      <br/>
      Whilst I'm waiting for her by the stile

      Oh I'd climb all the hills of the land

      For to shield her one moment from pain

      For she being my comfort in life

      And I'll rear up a nice family
