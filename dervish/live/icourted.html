  <p align="center">
   I courted a wee girl for many's the long day
   <br/>
   And I slighted all others that came in my way
   <br/>
   But now she's rewarded me to the last day
   <br/>
   She has gone to be wed to another
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The bride and bride's party to church, they did go
   <br/>
   The bride, she rode foremost, she put the best show
   <br/>
   And I followed after with a heart full of woe
   <br/>
   To see me love wed to another
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The bride and bride's party in church, they did stand
   <br/>
   Gold rings on their fingers, a love by the hand
   <br/>
   The man she is wed to, he has houses and land
   <br/>
   He may have her since I couldn't gain her
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The next time I saw her, she was seated down neat
   <br/>
   I sat down beside her, not a bite could I eat
   <br/>
   For I thought me love's company far better than meat
   <br/>
   Since love was the cause of my ruin
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The last time I saw her, she was all dressed in white
   <br/>
   The more I gazed on her, she dazzled my sight
   <br/>
   I lifted me hat and I bade her good night
   <br/>
   Here's adieu to all false-hearted lovers
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I courted that wee girl for many's the long day
   <br/>
   And I slighted all others that came in my way
   <br/>
   But now she's rewarded me to the last day
   <br/>
   She has gone to be wed to another
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So dig me a grave, and dig it down deep
   <br/>
   And strew it all over with primrose so sweet
   <br/>
   And lay me down easy, no more for to weep
   <br/>
   Since love was the cause of my ruin
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
