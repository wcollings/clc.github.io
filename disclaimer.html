their respective owners.

                   Second, I began collecting song translations long before I ever knew any 
HTML, much less even considered creating a web page of my own. As a result, 
I've long since lost track of where most of them originated. If anyone 
recognizes any translations as their own, please let me know and I will be 
glad to credit them.

                   Third and finally, I try to double check spellings before any lyrics are posted 
to the site.  However, with the variety of languages used on this site, I'm 
sure mistakes and typos have crept in. If you have any corrections, please 
feel free to send them along and I will make changes as necessary.

                   This is a message from the new maintainer, Will! I echo everything Kimberly said, however I don't own any of these CDs.
    As we in the newer generation do, I primarily stream them, so I theoretically have a bigger catalog to pull from. Whether or not
    I know what all's out there... that's another story altogether. When I took control of this, there were already
                   <i>
                    a lot
                   </i>
                   of songs,
    so I can't double check all of them. I only speak Gaidhlig, and barely at that, so even if I could check them all I can't
    guarantee anything. Feel free to reach out using the info on the
                   <a href="contact.html">
                    contact page
                   </a>
                   if you find something
    you'd like changed, and we'll see what we can do!
                   <br/>
                   <br/>
                   Thanks, and hope you enjoy the site!
