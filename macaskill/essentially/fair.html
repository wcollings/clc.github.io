  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Come all you fair and tender ladies
   <br/>
   Take warning how you court young men
   <br/>
   They're like a star on a summer morning
   <br/>
   They first appear and then they're gone
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   They'll tell to you some loving story
   <br/>
   And they make you think they love you well
   <br/>
   And away they'll go and court some other
   <br/>
   And leave you there in grief to dwell
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I wish I was on some tall mountain
   <br/>
   Where the ivy rocks are black as ink
   <br/>
   I'd write a letter to my false true lover
   <br/>
   Whose cheeks are like the morning pink
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh love is handsome, love is charming
   <br/>
   Love is pretty while it's new
   <br/>
   Love grows cold as love grows old
   <br/>
   And fades away like morning dew
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Come all you fair and tender ladies
   <br/>
   Take warning how you court young men
   <br/>
   They're like a star on a summer morning
   <br/>
   They first appear and then they're gone
   <br/>
   They first appear and then they're gone
  </p>
