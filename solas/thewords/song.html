  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Early every year, seeds are growing
   <br/>
   Unseen, unheard, they lie beneath the ground
   <br/>
   Would you know before the leaves are showing
   <br/>
   That with weeds all your garden will abound?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   If you close your eyes, stop your ears
   <br/>
   Hold your mouth, how can you know?
   <br/>
   The seeds you cannot see may not be there
   <br/>
   The seeds you cannot hear may never grow
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   In January you've still got the choice
   <br/>
   You can cut the weeds before they start to bud
   <br/>
   If you leave them to grow higher, they'll silence your voice
   <br/>
   And in December you may pay with your blood
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Close your eyes, stop your ears
   <br/>
   Close your mouth and take it slow
   <br/>
   Let others take the lead and you bring up the rear
   <br/>
   And later you can say you didn't know
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Everyday another vulture takes flight
   <br/>
   There's another danger born every morning
   <br/>
   In the darkness of your blindness the beast will learn to bite
   <br/>
   How can you fight if you can't recognize a warning?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Close your eyes, stop your ears
   <br/>
   Close your mouth and then you know
   <br/>
   Let others take the lead and you bring up the rear
   <br/>
   And later you can say you didn't know
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Today you may earn a living wage
   <br/>
   Tomorrow you may be on the dole
   <br/>
   Though there's millions going hungry, you needn't disengage
   <br/>
   For it's them, not you, that's fallen in the hole
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It's alright for you if you run with the pack
   <br/>
   It's alright if you agree with all they do
   <br/>
   If the fascist's party slowly climbing back
   <br/>
   It's not here yet, so what's it got to do with you?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The weeds are all around us and they're growing
   <br/>
   It will soon be too late for the knife
   <br/>
   If you leave them on the wind that around the world is blowing
   <br/>
   You may pay for your silence with your life
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Close your eyes, stop your ears
   <br/>
   Close your mouth, they're never there
   <br/>
   And if it happens here, they'll never come for you
   <br/>
   Because they'll know you really didn't care
  </p>
