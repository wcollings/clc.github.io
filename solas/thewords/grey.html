  <p align="center">
   In Norwa there sits a maid
   <br/>
   "Byloo, my baby," she begins
   <br/>
   "Little know I my child's father
   <br/>
   For if land or sea he's living in"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Then there arose at her bed feet
   <br/>
   A grumbly guest, I'm sure it was he
   <br/>
   Saying, "Here am I, thy child's father
   <br/>
   Although that I am not comely
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I am a man upon the land
   <br/>
   I am a selchie in the sea
   <br/>
   And when I am in my own country
   <br/>
   My dwelling is in Suleskerry"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Then he had taken a purse of gold
   <br/>
   And he hath put it upon her knee
   <br/>
   Saying, "Give to me my little wee son
   <br/>
   And take thee up thy nurse's fee
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It shall come to pass on a summer's day
   <br/>
   When the sun shines hot on every stone
   <br/>
   That I shall take my little wee son
   <br/>
   And teach him for to swim in the foam
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You will marry a gunner good
   <br/>
   And a proud good gunner I'm sure he will be
   <br/>
   But he'll go out on a May morning
   <br/>
   And kill both my wee son and me"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Loath she did marry a gunner good
   <br/>
   And a proud good gunner, I'm sure it was he
   <br/>
   The very first shot that he did shoot
   <br/>
   He killed the son and the gray selchie
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   In Norwa there sits a maid
   <br/>
   "Byloo, my baby," she begins
   <br/>
   "Little know I my child's father
   <br/>
   For if land or sea he's living in"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   In Norwa there sits a maid
