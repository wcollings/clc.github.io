  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I am a maid that sleeps in love and cannot feel my pain
   <br/>
   For once I had a sweetheart, and Johnny was his name
   <br/>
   And if I cannot find him, I'll wander night and day
   <br/>
   For it's for the sake of Johnny, I'll cross the stormy seas
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I'll cut off my yellow locks, men's clothing I'll wear on
   <br/>
   And like a gallant soldier boy this road I'll gang along
   <br/>
   Enquiring for a captain a passage to engage free
   <br/>
   For to be his chief companion on the banks of liberty
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The very first night the captain lay down on his bed to sleep
   <br/>
   These very words he said to me, "I wish you were a maid
   <br/>
   Your cherry cheeks and ruby lips, they've often enticed me
   <br/>
   I wish to the gods, unto my heart, a maid you were to me"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   In three days after that we did land on shore
   <br/>
   "Adieu, adieu, dear captain, adieu forever more
   <br/>
   A sailor boy I was on ship, but a maid I am on shore
   <br/>
   Adieu, adieu, dear captain, adieu forever more"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Come back, come back, my blooming girl, come back and marry me
   <br/>
   For I have a good fortune, I'll give it all to thee"
   <br/>
   "To marry you, dear captain, is more than I can say
   <br/>
   For it's for the sake of Johnny, I'll wander night and day"
  </p>
