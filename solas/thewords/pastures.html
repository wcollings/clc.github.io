  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It's a mighty hard row my poor hands have hoed
   <br/>
   My poor feet have travelled this hot dusty road
   <br/>
   Out of your dustbowl and westward we roam
   <br/>
   Through deserts so hot and through mountains so cold
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I've wandered all over your green, growing land
   <br/>
   Wherever your crops are, I'll lend you my hand
   <br/>
   On the edge of your cities, you'll see me and then
   <br/>
   I come with the dust and I'm gone with the wind
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   California, Arizona, I've worked on your crops
   <br/>
   And northward up to Oregon to gather your hops
   <br/>
   I've dug beets from the ground, I've cut grapes from the vine
   <br/>
   To set at your table that white sparkling wine
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Green pastures of plenty from the dry desert ground
   <br/>
   From the grand Coolie dam where the waters run down
   <br/>
   In every state of this union we migrants have been
   <br/>
   We work on the land and we'll fight until we win
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It's always we ramble, that river and I
   <br/>
   All along your green valleys I'll work 'til I die
   <br/>
   Travel this road until death sets me free
   <br/>
   'Cause pastures of plenty must always be free
  </p>
