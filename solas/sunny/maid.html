  <p align="center">
   There was a fair maid and she lived all alone
   <br/>
   She lived all alone on the shore
   <br/>
   No one could she find for to calm her sweet mind
   <br/>
   But to wander alone on the shore, shore, shore
   <br/>
   To wander alond on the shore
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There was a brave captain who sailed a fine ship
   <br/>
   And the weather being steady and fair
   <br/>
   "I shall die, I shall die," this dear captain did cry
   <br/>
   "If I can't have that maid on the shore, shore, shore
   <br/>
   If I can't have that maid on the shore"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   After many persuasions they brought her on board
   <br/>
   He seated her down on his chair
   <br/>
   He invited her down to his cabin below
   <br/>
   Farewell to all sorrow and care
   <br/>
   Farewell to all sorrow and care
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "I'll sing you a song," this fair maid did cry
   <br/>
   This captain was weeping for joy
   <br/>
   She sang it so sweetly, so soft and completely
   <br/>
   She sang the captain and sailors to sleep
   <br/>
   Captain and sailors to sleep
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She robbed them of jewels, she robbed them of wealth
   <br/>
   She robbed them of costly fine fare
   <br/>
   The captain's broadsword she used as an oar
   <br/>
   She rowed her way back to the shore, shore, shore
   <br/>
   She rowed her way back to the shore
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh the men, they were mad and the men, they were sad
   <br/>
   They were deeply sunk down in despair
   <br/>
   To see her go away with her booty so gay
   <br/>
   The rings and her things and her fine fare
   <br/>
   The rings and her things and her fine fare
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Well, don't be so sad and sunk down in despair
   <br/>
   And you should have known me before
   <br/>
   I sang you to sleep and I robbed you of wealth
   <br/>
   Well, again I'm a maid on the shore, shore, shore
   <br/>
   Again I'm a maid on the shore"
  </p>
