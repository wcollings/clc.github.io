<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
There was a fair maid and she lived all alone<br>
She lived all alone on the shore<br>
No one could she find for to calm her sweet mind<br>
But to wander alone on the shore, shore, shore<br>
To wander alond on the shore</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
There was a brave captain who sailed a fine ship<br>
And the weather being steady and fair<br>
"I shall die, I shall die," this dear captain did cry<br>
"If I can't have that maid on the shore, shore, shore<br>
If I can't have that maid on the shore"</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
After many persuasions they brought her on board<br>
He seated her down on his chair<br>
He invited her down to his cabin below<br>
Farewell to all sorrow and care<br>
Farewell to all sorrow and care</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
"I'll sing you a song," this fair maid did cry<br>
This captain was weeping for joy<br>
She sang it so sweetly, so soft and completely<br>
She sang the captain and sailors to sleep<br>
Captain and sailors to sleep</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
She robbed them of jewels, she robbed them of wealth<br>
She robbed them of costly fine fare<br>
The captain's broadsword she used as an oar<br>
She rowed her way back to the shore, shore, shore<br>
She rowed her way back to the shore</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
Oh the men, they were mad and the men, they were sad<br>
They were deeply sunk down in despair<br>
To see her go away with her booty so gay<br>
The rings and her things and her fine fare<br>
The rings and her things and her fine fare</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
"Well, don't be so sad and sunk down in despair<br>
And you should have known me before<br>
I sang you to sleep and I robbed you of wealth<br>
Well, again I'm a maid on the shore, shore, shore<br>
Again I'm a maid on the shore"</font></p></body>
