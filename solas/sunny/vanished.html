   Tell me, where did Helen go?
   <br/>
   This is where she had her dwelling
   <br/>
   She has vanished like the snow
   <br/>
   Where there is no way of telling
   <br/>
   This is where she had her dwelling
   <br/>
   And the while they come and they go
   <br/>
   Where there is no way of telling
   <br/>
   She has vanished like the snow
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   What became of Heloise?
   <br/>
   Abelard, he was her lover
   <br/>
   Once they lived in Saint-Denis
   <br/>
   Where they've gone, I can't discover
   <br/>
   Abelard, he was her lover
   <br/>
   All the while they come and they go
   <br/>
   Where they've gone I can't discover
   <br/>
   They have vanished like the snow
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Joan came riding from the rain
   <br/>
   Everybody knows the story
   <br/>
   England burned her in the rain
   <br/>
   Theirs the shame and hers the glory
   <br/>
   Everybody knows the story
   <br/>
   All the while they come and they go
   <br/>
   England's shame and France's glory
   <br/>
   When she vanished like the snow
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Where's the times and where's the places?
   <br/>
   That is what I'd like to know
   <br/>
   For they gloried in their graces
   <br/>
   When they vanished like the snow
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
