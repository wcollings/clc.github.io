  <p align="center">
   "Adieu, lovely Nancy, for now I must leave you
   <br/>
   To the far-off West Indies I'm bound for to steer
   <br/>
   But let my long journey be of no trouble to you
   <br/>
   For my love, I'll return in the course of a year"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Talk not of leaving me here, lovely Jimmy
   <br/>
   Talk not of leaving me here on the shore
   <br/>
   You know very well your long absence will grieve me
   <br/>
   As you sail the wild ocean where the wild billows roar
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I'll cut off my ringlets all curly and yellow
   <br/>
   I'll dress in the coats of a young cabin boy
   <br/>
   And when we are out on that dark, rolling ocean
   <br/>
   I will always be near you, my pride and my joy"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Your lily-white hands, they could not handle the cables
   <br/>
   Your lily-white feet to the top mast could not go
   <br/>
   And the cold winter storms, well, you could not endure them
   <br/>
   Stay at home, lovely Nancy, where the the wild winds won't blow"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   As Jimmy set a-sailing, lovely Nancy stood a-wailing
   <br/>
   The tears from her eyes in great torrents did a-flow
   <br/>
   As she stood on the beach, oh her hands she was wringing
   <br/>
   Crying, "Oh and alas, will I e'er see you more?"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   As Jimmy was a-walking on the quays of Philadelphia
   <br/>
   The thoughts of his true love, they filled him with pride
   <br/>
   He said, "Nancy, lovely Nancy, if I had you here, love
   <br/>
   How happy I'd be for to make you my bride"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So Jimmy wrote a letter to his own lovely Nancy
   <br/>
   Saying, "If you have proved constant, well, I will prove true"
   <br/>
   Oh but Nancy was dying, for her poor heart was broken
   <br/>
   Oh the day that he left her, forever he'd rue
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Come all of you young maidens, I pray, take a warning
   <br/>
   And don't trust a sailor boy or any of his kind
   <br/>
   For first they will court you and then they'll deceive you
   <br/>
   For their love, it is tempestuous as the wavering wind
  </p>
