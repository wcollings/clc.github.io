  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Remember the good times that we had
   <br/>
   I let them slip away from us when things got bad
   <br/>
   How clearly I first saw you smiling in the sun
   <br/>
   Want to feel your warmth upon, want to be the one
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   I will remember you
   <br/>
   Will you remember me?
   <br/>
   Don't let your life pass you by
   <br/>
   Weep not for the memories
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I'm so tired but I can't sleep
   <br/>
   Standing on the edge of something much too deep
   <br/>
   It's funny how we feel so much but we cannot say a word
   <br/>
   We are screaming inside but we can't be heard
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I'm so afraid to love you, but more afraid to lose
   <br/>
   Clinging to a past that doesn't let me choose
   <br/>
   Once there was a darkness, deep and endless night
   <br/>
   You gave me everything you had, you gave me light
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus 2x)
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
