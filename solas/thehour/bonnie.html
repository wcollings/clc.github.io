  <p align="center">
   Bonnie Mae a-shepherding has gone
   <br/>
   To call the sheep to the fold
   <br/>
   And aye, as she sang, her bonny voice, it rang
   <br/>
   Right over the tops of the downs, downs
   <br/>
   Over the tops of the downs
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There came a troop of gentlemen
   <br/>
   As they were riding by
   <br/>
   And one of them has lighted down
   <br/>
   And he's asked of her the way, the way
   <br/>
   He's asked of her the way
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Ride on, ride on, you rank riders
   <br/>
   Your steeds are stout and strong
   <br/>
   For it's out of the fold I will not go
   <br/>
   For fear you'll do me wrong, wrong
   <br/>
   Fear you'll do me wrong"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Now he's taken her by the middle jip
   <br/>
   And by the green gown sleeve
   <br/>
   And there he's had his will of her
   <br/>
   And he's asked of her no leave, no leave
   <br/>
   He's asked of her no leave
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Oh I've ridden east and I've ridden west
   <br/>
   And I've ridden o'er the downs
   <br/>
   But the bonniest lass that ever I saw
   <br/>
   Is calling her sheep to the fold"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She has taken the milk pail on her head
   <br/>
   And she's gone lingering home
   <br/>
   And all her father said to her
   <br/>
   Was, "Daughter, you've done me wrong, wrong
   <br/>
   Daughter, you've done me wrong"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Now twenty weeks were gone and past
   <br/>
   Twenty weeks and three
   <br/>
   And the lassie began to fret and to frown
   <br/>
   And to long for his twinkling eye, bright eye
   <br/>
   Long for his twinkling eye
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Now it fell on a day, and a bonny summer's day
   <br/>
   For she walked out alone
   <br/>
   That selfsame troop of gentlemen
   <br/>
   Came riding o'er the downs, downs
   <br/>
   Riding o'er the downs
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Who got the babe with thee, Bonnie Mae?
   <br/>
   Who got the babe in thy arms?"
   <br/>
   For shame she blushed and aye, she said
   <br/>
   "Oh I've a good man of my own"
   <br/>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "You lie, you lie, you bonny, bonny Mae
   <br/>
   So loud I hear you lie
   <br/>
   Remember the misty, murky night
   <br/>
   I lay in the fold with thee, with thee
   <br/>
   I lay in the fold with thee
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Now he's lighted off his berry-brown steed
   <br/>
   He's set the fair Mae on
   <br/>
   "Go call out your fold, good father, yourself
   <br/>
   She'll ne'er call them again, again
   <br/>
   She'll ne'er call them again"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   For he's the Lord of Achentrioch
   <br/>
   With fifty plough and three
   <br/>
   And he's taken away the bonniest lass
   <br/>
   In all the south country, country
   <br/>
   In all the south country
  </p>
