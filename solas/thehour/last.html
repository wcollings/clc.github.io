  </p>
  <p align="center">
   My soul has been torn from me, and I am bleeding
   <br/>
   My heart, it has been rent, and I am crying
   <br/>
   All the beauty around me fades, and I am screaming
   <br/>
   I am the last of the great whales and I am dying
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Last night I heard the cry of my last companion
   <br/>
   The roar of the harpoon gun, and then I was alone
   <br/>
   I thought on the days gone by when we were thousands
   <br/>
   But I know that I soon must die, the last leviathan
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   This morning the sun did rise, crimson edge to the north sky
   <br/>
   The ice was the color of blood, and the winds, they did sigh
   <br/>
   I rose for to take a breath, it was my last one
   <br/>
   From a gun came the roar of death, and now I am done
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And so since time began, we have been hunted
   <br/>
   Through oceans that were our homes we have been haunted
   <br/>
   From Eskimos in canoes to mighty whalers
   <br/>
   Still you ignored our pleas, none came to save us
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh now that we all are gone, there is no more hunting
   <br/>
   The big fellow is no more, it's no use lamenting
   <br/>
   What race will be next in line all for the slaughter?
   <br/>
   The elephant or the seal, or your sons and daughters?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   My soul has been torn from me, and I am bleeding
   <br/>
   My heart, it has been rent, and I am crying
   <br/>
   All the beauty around me fades, and I am screaming
   <br/>
   I am the last of the great whales and I am dying
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
