  <p align="center">
   Don't sing love songs, you'll wake my mother
   <br/>
   She's sleeping here right by my side
   <br/>
   In her right hand a silver dagger
   <br/>
   She says that I can't be your bride
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   All men are fools, so says my mother
   <br/>
   They'll tell you again love and lies
   <br/>
   And then they'll go and court some other
   <br/>
   Leave you alone to pine inside
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   My daddy is a handsome devil
   <br/>
   He's got a chain five miles long
   <br/>
   On every link a heart does dangle
   <br/>
   Of another maid he's loved and wronged
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Go court another tender maiden
   <br/>
   In hopes that she might be your wife
   <br/>
   For I've been warned, so I decided
   <br/>
   I'll sleep alone all of my life
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Don't sing love songs, you'll wake my mother
   <br/>
   She's sleeping here right by my side
   <br/>
   In her right hand a silver dagger
   <br/>
   She says that I can't be your bride
  </p>
