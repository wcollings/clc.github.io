  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I must away, love, no longer tarry
   <br/>
   This roaring tempest I have to cross
   <br/>
   I must be guided without a fall
   <br/>
   Into the arms I love the best
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When he came to his true love's dwelling
   <br/>
   He's knelt down gently upon a stone
   <br/>
   Through the window he's whispered soft
   <br/>
   "Is my true lover within at home?"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She's raised her up from off her pillow
   <br/>
   She's raised her up from off her bed
   <br/>
   And through the window she's whispered soft
   <br/>
   "Who's that disturbing my own night's rest?"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Wake up, wake up, love, it's your own true lover
   <br/>
   Wake up, wake up, love, and let me in
   <br/>
   Oh how the wind blows and how it rains
   <br/>
   Oh I am wet, love, unto the skin"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She's raised her up from off her pillow
   <br/>
   She's raised her up and let him
   <br/>
   They were locked in each other's arms
   <br/>
   Until the long night was passed and gone
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When the long night was passed and gone
   <br/>
   When the dark clouds, they did divide
   <br/>
   He's leaned down gently and kissed her soft
   <br/>
   He saddled up and away did ride
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He's mounted up on his horse and away did ride
   <br/>
   He's mounted up on his horse and away did ride
  </p>
