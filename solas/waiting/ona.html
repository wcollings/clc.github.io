  <p align="center">
   I adore thee, Mother Mary
   <br/>
   But would you change me back to a witch
   <br/>
   And let me live in the arms of a sorry old elm?
   <br/>
   Give the gypsy moths a realm of their own
   <br/>
   For a postman's fee would I work for thee
   <br/>
   From that tree would I swoop down and leave
   <br/>
   A billion blue eggs of eternity
   <br/>
   And in no time you'd have your own sea
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Don't just stare, I mean it really
   <br/>
   Hear my prayer, I give it freely
   <br/>
   Are you there, fleur de lis?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I adore thee, Mother Mary
   <br/>
   But would you change me back to a witch
   <br/>
   And let me live in the arms of a willow?
   <br/>
   Fly around not wearing a stitch
   <br/>
   For so long has this room been so hollow
   <br/>
   We wait at the gate for an echo
   <br/>
   In the flesh of your newly-cleaned frescoes
   <br/>
   Where Jesus holds John to his breast
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Wrapped around and rocking slowly
   <br/>
   No one bound to be so holy
   <br/>
   In your gown of fleur de lis
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I adore thee, Mother Mary
   <br/>
   But would you change my back to a witch?
   <br/>
   As a witch would I love you more than any man
   <br/>
   So give a wink, give a nod, give a damn
   <br/>
   Be a sport, Mary, and don't tell dad
   <br/>
   He need never know how he's been had
   <br/>
   Never you mind about those seven seals
   <br/>
   'Cause daddy was a one-shot deal
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   One, two, three, it could be that easy
   <br/>
   There we'd be, I with my baby
   <br/>
   On a sea of fleur de lis
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Do re mi, it could be that easy
   <br/>
   There we'd be, I with my baby
   <br/>
   On a sea of fleur de lis
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
