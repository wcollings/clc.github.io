  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, a plowman dresses fine, he drinks strong ale and wine
   <br/>
   And the best of tobacco he does smoke
   <br/>
   Pretty maids, don't think amiss a plowman for to kiss
   <br/>
   For his breath is as sweet as the rose, the rose
   <br/>
   For his breath is as sweet as the rose
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, a plowman in his shirt completely does his work
   <br/>
   And so loudly to the little boy does call
   <br/>
   Saying, "Be nimble and be quick with the swishing of your stick"
   <br/>
   And so merrily he rattles them along, along
   <br/>
   And do merrily he rattles them along
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When our shears are shod, to the blacksmith off we trod
   <br/>
   And so loudly to the blacksmith we do call
   <br/>
   Saying, "Be nimble and be quick, throw your blows in thick"
   <br/>
   And so merrily he'll swing his hammer 'round, around
   <br/>
   And so merrily he'll swing his hammer 'round
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When our shears are done, to the alehouse we do run
   <br/>
   And so loudly to the landlord we do call
   <br/>
   Saying, "Bring to us some beer, for while I am here"
   <br/>
   A plowman is always running dry, dry
   <br/>
   A plowman is always running dry
  </p>
