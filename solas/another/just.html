  <p align="center">
   I'll never again be there when you waken
   <br/>
   Be there when you open your eyes
   <br/>
   I'll never again hear the words that you whisper
   <br/>
   I'll never again see you smile
   <br/>
   You will be there when I'm closing my eyes
   <br/>
   Still in my thoughts, still on my mind
   <br/>
   Holding my hand when there's nobody there
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It's taken a while just to go on as normal
   <br/>
   You've taken the light from my eyes
   <br/>
   But I know that you're with me whenever I falter
   <br/>
   Lately that's most of the time
   <br/>
   Can't understand how it happened this way
   <br/>
   Was this the plan from the very first day?
   <br/>
   I once had it all, now it's slipping away
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   All I wanted was you
   <br/>
   All I wanted was you
   <br/>
   All I wanted was you
   <br/>
   Just you
   <br/>
   (2x)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Just you
  </p>
