    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   All that you ask me is that I remember
   <br/>
   That I remember what we've been through
   <br/>
   All that I'm saying is that I remember
   <br/>
   That I remember you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Some people say that miles make no difference
   <br/>
   Miles are the distance between me and you
   <br/>
   And watch out for love, it's not gold 'cause it glistens
   <br/>
   Cheap reminiscence ain't worthy of you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   If it's not all or nothing, it's not worth the giving
   <br/>
   Love's not worth the living 'til it's put to the test
   <br/>
   And no guarantees doesn't mean I'm not buying
   <br/>
   Just means we keep trying even more than the rest
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There's no sadness in leaving if you leave for a reason
   <br/>
   The best of all reasons is to come back again
   <br/>
   And tears in the morning can bring joy in the evening
   <br/>
   Just keep believing that love finds a way
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus 2x)
  </p>
