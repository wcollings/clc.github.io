     Lyrics

    :
   </b>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It's a thin line that leads us and keeps a man from shame
   <br/>
   And dark clouds quickly gather along the way he came
   <br/>
   There's fear out on the mountain and death out on the plain
   <br/>
   There's heartbreak and heartache in the shadow of the flame
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   This love will carry
   <br/>
   This love will carry me
   <br/>
   I know this love will carry me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The strongest web will tangle, the sweetest bloom will fall
   <br/>
   And somewhere in the distance we try and catch it all
   <br/>
   Success lasts for a moment, and failure's always near
   <br/>
   And you look down at your blistered hands as turns another year
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   These days are golden, they must not waste away
   <br/>
   For our time is like that flower, and soon it will decay
   <br/>
   And though by storms we're weakened, uncertainty is sure
   <br/>
   And like the coming of the dawn, it's ours forevermore
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus 2x)
  </p>
