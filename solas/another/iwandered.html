   I wandered by a brookside, I wandered by a mill
   <br/>
   I could not hear the water, the murmuring, it was still
   <br/>
   Not a sound of any grasshopper nor the chirp of any bird
   <br/>
   But the beating of my own heart was the only sound I heard
   <br/>
   The beating of my own heart was the only sound I heard
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Then silent tears fast flowing when someone stood beside
   <br/>
   A hand upon my shoulder, I knew the touch was kind
   <br/>
   He drew me near and nearer, we neither spoke one word
   <br/>
   But the beating of our own two hearts was the only sound I heard
   <br/>
   But the beating of our own two hearts was the only sound I heard
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The beating of our own two hearts was the only sound I heard
   <br/>
   But the beating of our own two hearts was the only sound I heard
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
