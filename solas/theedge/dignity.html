  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Wise man lookin' in a blade of grass
   <br/>
   Young man lookin' in shadows that pass
   <br/>
   Poor man lookin' through painted glass
   <br/>
   Fat man lookin' in a blade of steel
   <br/>
   Thin man lookin' at his last meal
   <br/>
   Hollow man lookin' in a cottonfield
   <br/>
   For dignity
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Drinkin' man listens to the voice he hears
   <br/>
   In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors
   <br/>
   Lookin' into the lost forgotten years
   <br/>
   For dignity
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I went down where the vultures feed
   <br/>
   Would have got deeper, but there wasn't any need
   <br/>
   I heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of man
   <br/>
   Wasn't any difference to me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Sick man lookin' for the doctor's cure
   <br/>
   Lookin' at his hands for the lines that were
   <br/>
   Into every masterpiece of literature
   <br/>
   Blind man breakin' out of a trance
   <br/>
   Puts both hands in the pockets of chance
   <br/>
   Hopin' to find one circumstance
   <br/>
   Of dignity
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Footprints runnin' across silver sand
   <br/>
   Steps goin' down into tatoo land
   <br/>
   Met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
   <br/>
   In the border towns of despair
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   No place to fade, I got no coat
   <br/>
   I'm on the rolling river in a jerkin' boat
   <br/>
   Trying to read a note somebody wrote
   <br/>
   Englishman stranded in the blackheart wind
   <br/>
   Combin' his hair back, his future looks thin
   <br/>
   Bites the bullet and looks within
   <br/>
   For dignity
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed
   <br/>
   Dignity never been photographed
   <br/>
   I went into the red, I went into the black
   <br/>
   Into the valley of dry-bone dreams
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So many roads, so much at stake
   <br/>
   So many dead ends, I'm at the edge of a lake
   <br/>
   Sometimes I wonder what it's gonna take
   <br/>
   To find dignity
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
