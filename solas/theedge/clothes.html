   </b>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Who has dressed you in strange clothes of sand?
   <br/>
   Who has taken you far from my land?
   <br/>
   Who has said that my sayings were wrong?
   <br/>
   Who will say that I stayed much too long?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Clothes of sand have covered your face
   <br/>
   Given you meaning, but taken my place
   <br/>
   So make your way on down to the sea
   <br/>
   Something has taken you so far from me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Does it now seem worth all the color of skies
   <br/>
   To see the earth through painted eyes?
   <br/>
   To look through panes of shaded glass
   <br/>
   See the stains of winter's grass?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Can you now return to from where you came?
   <br/>
   Try to burn your changing name
   <br/>
   Or with silver spoons and colored light
   <br/>
   Will you worship moons in winter's night?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
 </body>
