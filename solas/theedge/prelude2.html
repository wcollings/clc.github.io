  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Cold was the night, hard was the ground
   <br/>
   They found her in a small grove of trees
   <br/>
   Lonesome was the place where Georgia was found
   <br/>
   She's too young to be out on the street
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Why wasn't God watching?
   <br/>
   Why wasn't God listening?
   <br/>
   Why wasn't God there for Georgia Lee?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Ida couldn't keep Georgia from dropping out of school
   <br/>
   I was doing the best that I could
   <br/>
   But she just kept running away from this world
   <br/>
   These children are so hard to raise good
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Close your eyes and count to ten
   <br/>
   I will go and hide, but then
   <br/>
   Be sure to find me
   <br/>
   I want you to find me
   <br/>
   And we'll play all over
   <br/>
   We'll play all over
   <br/>
   We'll play all over again
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There's a toad in the witch grass, there's a crow in the corn
   <br/>
   Wild flowers on a cross by the road
   <br/>
   And somewhere a baby is crying for her mom
   <br/>
   As the hills turn from green back to gold
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus 2x)
  </p>
