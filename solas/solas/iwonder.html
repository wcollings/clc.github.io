  <p align="center">
   I wonder what's keeping my true love tonight
   <br/>
   I wonder what's keeping her out of my sight
   <br/>
   It is little she knows of the pain that I endure
   <br/>
   Or she would not stay from me this night, I am sure
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh love, are you coming your cause to advance?
   <br/>
   Oh love, are you waiting for a far better chance?
   <br/>
   Or have you got a sweetheart laid by you in store?
   <br/>
   And you're coming to tell me that you love me no more?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh love, I'm not coming my cause to advance
   <br/>
   And love, I'm not waiting for a far better chance
   <br/>
   But I have got a sweetheart laid by me in store
   <br/>
   And I'm coming to tell you that I love you no more
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   For 'tis I can love lightly and 'tis I can love long
   <br/>
   And 'tis I can love the old love 'til the new love comes along
   <br/>
   I just said that I loved you for to set your mind at ease
   <br/>
   But when I'm far from you, I'll love whom I please
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, I've gold in my pocket and I've love in my heart
   <br/>
   But I can't love a maiden who has got two sweethearts
   <br/>
   Your love, it lies as lightly as the dew upon a thorn
   <br/>
   Comes down in the evening, goes away in the morn
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Green grass, it grows bonny, spring water runs clear
   <br/>
   I am weary and lonesome for the love of my dear
   <br/>
   You're my first and false true love and 'tis lately I knew
   <br/>
   That the fonder I loved you, the falser you grew
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
