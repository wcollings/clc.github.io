  </p>
  <p align="center">
   In Newry town I was bred and born
   <br/>
   In Stephens Green now I lie in scorn
   <br/>
   I served me time at the saddler's trade
   <br/>
   I always was a roving blade
   <br/>
   I always was a roving blade
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   At seventeen I took a wife
   <br/>
   I loved her dearer than I loved me life
   <br/>
   And so to keep her both fine and gay
   <br/>
   I went out robbing on the king's highway
   <br/>
   I went out robbing on the king's highway
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I never robbed a poor man yet
   <br/>
   Nor lately caused anyone to fret
   <br/>
   But I robbed lords and ladies fine
   <br/>
   And I carried the gold home to me heart's delight
   <br/>
   I carried the gold home to me heart's delight
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I robbed Lord Baldwin, I do declare
   <br/>
   And Lady Manswell up in Grovenors Square
   <br/>
   I closed me shutters and bade them good night
   <br/>
   And I carried the gold home to me heart's delight
   <br/>
   I carried the gold home to me heart's delight
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   To Covent Garden I made my way
   <br/>
   With me dear wife for to see the play
   <br/>
   The Fielding's men there did me pursue
   <br/>
   And I was taken by that cursed crew
   <br/>
   Oh I was taken by that cursed crew
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   My father cried, "Oh me darling son"
   <br/>
   My wife, she cried, "Now I am undone"
   <br/>
   My mother tore her gray locks and cried
   <br/>
   It's in the cradle I should have died
   <br/>
   It's in the cradle I should have died
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When I am dead, I want for my grave
   <br/>
   A flashy funeral pray let me have
   <br/>
   Six highwaymen for to carry me
   <br/>
   Oh give them broadswords and sweet liberty
   <br/>
   Oh give them broadswords and sweet liberty
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
