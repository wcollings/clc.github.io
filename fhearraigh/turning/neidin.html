   As I leave behind Neidin
   <br/>
   It's like purple splashed on green
   <br/>
   My soul is strangely led
   <br/>
   Through the winding hills ahead
   <br/>
   And she plays a melody
   <br/>
   On winds and streams for me
   <br/>
   Won't you remember
   <br/>
   Won't you remember
   <br/>
   Won't you remember me?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And we wind and climb and fall
   <br/>
   Like the greatest waltz of all
   <br/>
   Float across the floor
   <br/>
   Her sweet breath outside the door
   <br/>
   And it's time that I was gone
   <br/>
   Cross the silver tear
   <br/>
   Won't you remember
   <br/>
   Won't you remember
   <br/>
   Won't you remember me?
   <br/>
   Won't you remember
   <br/>
   Won't you remember
   <br/>
   Won't you remember me?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   As I leave behind Neidin
   <br/>
   In the hall where we have been
   <br/>
   Rhododendrons in her hair
   <br/>
   In the mountain-scented air
   <br/>
   I still feel her spirit song
   <br/>
   Cross the silver tear
   <br/>
   Won't you remember
   <br/>
   Won't you remember
   <br/>
   Won't you remember me?
   <br/>
   Won't you remember
   <br/>
   Won't you remember
   <br/>
   Won't you remember me?
  </p>
