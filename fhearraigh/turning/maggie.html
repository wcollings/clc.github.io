  <p align="center">
   The violets were scenting the woods, Maggie
   <br/>
   Displaying their charms to the bees
   <br/>
   When I first said I loved only you, Maggie
   <br/>
   And you said you loved only me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The chestnut bloom gleams through the glade, Maggie
   <br/>
   The robin sang out from every tree
   <br/>
   When I first said I loved only you, Maggie
   <br/>
   And you said you loved only me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The golden-dew daffodil shone, Maggie
   <br/>
   And danced in the breeze on the lee
   <br/>
   When I first said I loved only you, Maggie
   <br/>
   And you said you loved only me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The birds in the trees sang their songs, Maggie
   <br/>
   Of happier transports to be
   <br/>
   When I first said I loved only you, Maggie
   <br/>
   And you said you loved only me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Our hopes, they have never come true, Maggie
   <br/>
   Our dreams, they were never to be
   <br/>
   Since I first said I loved only you, Maggie
   <br/>
   And you said you loved only me
  </p>

  </cleaned>
