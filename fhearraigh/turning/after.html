  <p align="center">
   Well, I dreamed I saw the knights in armor coming
   <br/>
   Saying something about a queen
   <br/>
   There were peasants singing and drummers drumming
   <br/>
   And the archer split the tree
   <br/>
   There was a fanfare blowing to the sun
   <br/>
   That was floating on the breeze
   <br/>
   Look at Mother Nature on the run
   <br/>
   In the nineteen-seventies
   <br/>
   Look at Mother Nature on the run
   <br/>
   In the nineteen-seventies
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I was lying in a burned-out basement
   <br/>
   With the full moon in my eyes
   <br/>
   I was hoping for replacement
   <br/>
   When the sun burst through the sky
   <br/>
   There was a band playing in my head
   <br/>
   And I felt like getting high
   <br/>
   I was thinking about what a friend had said
   <br/>
   I was hoping it was a lie
   <br/>
   Thinking about what a friend had said
   <br/>
   I was hoping it was a lie
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, I dreamed I saw the silver space ships flying
   <br/>
   In the yellow haze of the sun
   <br/>
   There were children crying and colors flying
   <br/>
   All around the chosen ones
   <br/>
   All in a dream, all in a dream
   <br/>
   The loading had begun
   <br/>
   They were flying Mother Nature's silver seed
   <br/>
   To a new home in the sun
   <br/>
   Flying Mother Nature's silver seed
   <br/>
   To a new home
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
