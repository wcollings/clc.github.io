  <p align="center">
   I learned the truth at seventeen
   <br/>
   That love was meant for beauty queens
   <br/>
   And high school girls with clear-skinned smiles
   <br/>
   Who married young and then retired
   <br/>
   The valentines I never knew
   <br/>
   The Friday night charades of youth
   <br/>
   Were spent on one more beautiful
   <br/>
   At seventeen I learned the truth
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And those of us with ravaged faces
   <br/>
   Lacking in the social graces
   <br/>
   Desperately remained at home
   <br/>
   Inventing lovers on the phone
   <br/>
   Who'd call to say, "Come dance with me"
   <br/>
   And murmured vague obscenities
   <br/>
   It isn't all it seems at seventeen
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   A brown-eyed girl in hand-me-downs
   <br/>
   Whose name I never could pronounce
   <br/>
   Said, "Pity, please, the ones who serve
   <br/>
   They only get what they deserve"
   <br/>
   The rich-relationed hometown queen
   <br/>
   She marries into what she needs
   <br/>
   A guarantee of company
   <br/>
   And heaven for the elderly
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Remember, those who win the game
   <br/>
   Lose the love they sought to gain
   <br/>
   Indebentures of quality
   <br/>
   And dubious integrity
   <br/>
   Their small town eyes will gape at you
   <br/>
   In dull surprise when payment due
   <br/>
   Exceeds accounts received at seventeen
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   To those of us who know the pain
   <br/>
   Of valentines that never came
   <br/>
   And those whose names were never called
   <br/>
   When choosing sides for basketball
   <br/>
   It was long ago and far away
   <br/>
   The world was younger than today
   <br/>
   And dreams were all they gave for free
   <br/>
   To ugly duckling girls like me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We all play the game and when we dare
   <br/>
   To cheat ourselves at solitaire
   <br/>
   Inventing lovers on the phone
   <br/>
   Repenting other lives unknown
   <br/>
   That call and say, "Come dance with me"
   <br/>
   And murmur vague obscenities
   <br/>
   At ugly girls like me at seventeen
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
