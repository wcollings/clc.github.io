   Good King Wenceslaus looked out on the Feast of Stephen
   <br/>
   When the snow lay 'round about, deep and crisp and even
   <br/>
   Brightly shone the moon that night, though the frost was cruel
   <br/>
   When a poor man came in sight, gathering winter fuel
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Hither, page, and stand by me, if thou knowst it telling
   <br/>
   Yonder peasant, who is he? Where and what his dwelling?"
   <br/>
   "Sire, he lives a good league hence, underneath the mountain
   <br/>
   Right against the forest fence, by St. Anges' fountain"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Bring me flesh and bring me wine, bring me pine logs hither
   <br/>
   Thou and I will see him dine when we bear them thither"
   <br/>
   Page and monarch, forth they went, forth they went together
   <br/>
   Through the rude wind's wild lament and the bitter weather
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Sire, the night is darker now, and the wind blows stronger
   <br/>
   Fails my heart, I know not how, I can go no longer"
   <br/>
   "Mark my footsteps good, my page, tred thou in them boldly
   <br/>
   Thou shalt find the winter's rage freeze thy blood less coldly"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   In his master's steps he trod where the snow lay dinted
   <br/>
   Heat was in the very sod which the saint hath printed
   <br/>
   Therefore Christian men, be sure, wealth or rank possessing
   <br/>
   Ye who now will bless the poor, shall yourselves find blessing
  </p>
