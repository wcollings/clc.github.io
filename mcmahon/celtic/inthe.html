     Lyrics

  </p>
  <p align="center">
   In the bleak mid-winter frosty wind made moan
   <br/>
   Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone
   <br/>
   Snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow
   <br/>
   In the bleak mid-winter long ago
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Our God, heaven cannot hold Him, nor earth sustain
   <br/>
   Heaven and earth shall flee away when He comes to reign
   <br/>
   In the bleak mid-winter a stable place sufficed
   <br/>
   The Lord God Almighty, Jesus Christ
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Enough for Him, whom cherubim worship night and day
   <br/>
   A breast full of milk and a manger full of hay
   <br/>
   Enough for Him, whom angels fall down before
   <br/>
   The ox and ass and camel which adore
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   What can I give Him, poor as I am?
   <br/>
   If I were a shepherd, I would give a lamb
   <br/>
   If I were a wise man, I would do my part
   <br/>
   Yet what can I give Him? Give my heart
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
