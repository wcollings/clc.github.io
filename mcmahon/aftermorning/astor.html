  <p align="center">
   A stór mo chroí, when you're far away
   <br/>
   From the home you will soon be leaving
   <br/>
   'Tis many a time by night and by day
   <br/>
   Your heart will be sorely grieving
   <br/>
   The stranger's land may be bright and fair
   <br/>
   And rich in its treasures golden
   <br/>
   You'll pine, I know, for the land long ago
   <br/>
   And the love that is never olden
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   A stór mo chroí, in this stranger's land
   <br/>
   There is plenty of wealth and wailing
   <br/>
   Where gems adorn the great and grand
   <br/>
   There are faces with hunger paling
   <br/>
   When the road is tiresome and hard to tread
   <br/>
   And the lights of their cities blind you
   <br/>
   Oh turn, a stór, back to Ireland's shore
   <br/>
   And the one you leave behind you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   A stór mo chroí, when the evening mist
   <br/>
   Over mountain and sea is falling
   <br/>
   Oh turn around and when you list
   <br/>
   Then maybe you'll hear me calling
   <br/>
   The sound of my voice you might hear
   <br/>
   Which calls for your speedy returning
   <br/>
   A rún, a rún, won't you come back soon
   <br/>
   To the one who will always love you?
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
