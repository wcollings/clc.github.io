  <p align="center">
   One morn in May when fields were gay
   <br/>
   Serene and pleasant was the weather
   <br/>
   I spied a lass and a bonnie bonnie lass
   <br/>
   She was whoopin' the dew fray among the heather
   <br/>
   Down the moon
   <br/>
   In among the heather o'er the moor and through the heather
   <br/>
   I spied a lass and a bonnie bonnie lass
   <br/>
   She was whoopin' the dew fray among the heather
   <br/>
   Down the moon
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I steppened up to this fair maid
   <br/>
   What is your name? Come tell me hither
   <br/>
   And she answered me down by the bonnie burn side
   <br/>
   And I herding all my ewes together
   <br/>
   Down the moor
   <br/>
   In among the heather o'er the moor and through the heather
   <br/>
   And she answered me down by the bonnie burn side
   <br/>
   And I herding all my ewes together
   <br/>
   Down the moor
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Barefoot was she, she was comely dressed
   <br/>
   And on her head ne'er hat nor feather
   <br/>
   But the plait hung neatly around her waist
   <br/>
   As we tripped through the blooming heather
   <br/>
   Down the moor
   <br/>
   In among the heather o'er the moor and through the heather
   <br/>
   But the plait hung neatly around her waist
   <br/>
   As we tripped through the blooming heather
   <br/>
   Down the moor
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   O'er the moor and through the heather
   <br/>
   But the plait hung neatly around her waist
   <br/>
   As we tripped through the blooming heather
   <br/>
   Down the moor
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I courted her that lee long day
   <br/>
   My heart was as light as any feather
   <br/>
   Until the rays of the red setting sun
   <br/>
   Came shining down in among the heather
   <br/>
   Down the moor
   <br/>
   In among the heather o'er the moor and through the heather
   <br/>
   Until the rays of the red setting sun
   <br/>
   Came shining down in among the heather
   <br/>
   Down the moor
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Then up she got and away she went
   <br/>
   Her name and place I can not gather
   <br/>
   But if I was a king, I'd make her my queen
   <br/>
   That bonnie wee lass I met among the heather
   <br/>
   Down the moor
   <br/>
   In among the heather o'er the moor and through the heather
   <br/>
   But if I was a king, I'd make her my queen
   <br/>
   That bonnie wee lass I met among the heather
   <br/>
   Down the moor
