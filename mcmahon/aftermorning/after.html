  <p align="center">
   Oh after the morning there comes an evening
   <br/>
   And after the evening another day
   <br/>
   And after a false love there comes a true love
   <br/>
   I'd have you listen now to what I have to say
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   My love he is as fine a young man
   <br/>
   As fair as any the sun shines on
   <br/>
   But how to save him, I do not know it
   <br/>
   For now he's got a sentence to be hung
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   As he was a-marchin' the streets of Derry
   <br/>
   I own he marched upright manly
   <br/>
   Being much more like a commanding officer
   <br/>
   Than a man to die upon the gallows tree
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   What keeps my love? She's so long in comin'
   <br/>
   Oh what detains her so long from me?
   <br/>
   Or does she think it a shame or scandal
   <br/>
   To see me die upon the gallows tree?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He looked around and he saw her comin'
   <br/>
   As she rode swifter than the wind
   <br/>
   I'll let them see that they dare not hang you
   <br/>
   And I'll crown my love with a bunch of free
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
