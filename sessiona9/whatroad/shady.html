   Peaches in the summer time
   <br/>
   Apples in the fall
   <br/>
   If I can't have the girl I love
   <br/>
   I won't have none at all
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus (after each verse)
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Shady grove, my little love
   <br/>
   Oh shady grove, I know
   <br/>
   Shady grove, my little love
   <br/>
   I'm bound for shady grove
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And if I had a banjo string
   <br/>
   Made of gold and twine
   <br/>
   Every tune I'd play on it
   <br/>
   I'd wish that girl was mine
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And if I had a needle and thread
   <br/>
   Lord, the means to sew
   <br/>
   I sew that girl to the side of myself
   <br/>
   And I'd head off down the road
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Some come here to fiddle and dance
   <br/>
   Some come here to tarry
   <br/>
   Some come here to fiddle and dance
   <br/>
   And I come here to marry
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Every night 'ere I get home
   <br/>
   My wife, I try to please her
   <br/>
   But the harder I try, the worse she gets
   <br/>
   I'm damned if I don't leave her
  </p>
