  <p align="center">
   As I was walking o'er yon hill
   <br/>
   It was a pleasant evening
   <br/>
   'Twas there I spied a bonny lass
   <br/>
   Skipping barefoot through the heather
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And oh but she was neatly dressed
   <br/>
   She needed neither cap nor feather
   <br/>
   She was the queen among them all
   <br/>
   Skipping barefoot through the heather
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Her gown, it was a bonny blue
   <br/>
   Her petticoat, a pheasant color
   <br/>
   And in between the stripes was seen
   <br/>
   Shining bales of blooming heather
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Says I then, "Lassie, will you go wi' me?
   <br/>
   Will you go wi' me and leave the heather?
   <br/>
   It's silks and satins you shall have
   <br/>
   If you'll wi' me and leave the heather"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Says she, "Kind sir, your offer's good
   <br/>
   It's well I ken you will deceive me
   <br/>
   So gin I gie my love all o'er
   <br/>
   It's better no I've never seen ye"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And oh but she was neatly dressed
   <br/>
   She needed neither cap nor feather
   <br/>
   She was the queen among them all
   <br/>
   Skipping barefoot through the heather
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
