<b><u>Seanduine Doite</b></u>(Gaeilge)
Chuir m\'e mo sheanduine
Instreach ins a choirn\'eal
a dh'ol bainne ramhair
is a th'ithe ar\'ain eornan
Da gcuirfeadh se a cheann amach
Bhainfinn an sr\'on de
Agus d'fhuigfinn an chuid eile
Ag na cailini \'oga

<u>C\'urfa:</u>
\'Oro, 'sheanduine, 'sheanduine d\'oite
\'Oro, 'sheanduine, , is mairg a ph\'os thu
\'Oro, 'sheanduine, 'sheanduine d\'oite
Luigh ar do leaba is codail do dhothain

D\'a bhfaighinnse mo sheanduine
b\'aite i bpoll m\'onadh
a chosa bheith briste
is a loirgni leonta
Thabharfainn na bhaile \'e
is shinfinn faoi chl\'ar e
is sh\u'ilfinn amach
Leis na buachailli \'oga

D\'a bhfeicf\'ea mo sheanduine
Ar bharr an mh\'ean oiche
'Chois ar an bhac aige
Is \'e deargadh a phiopa
Gur chos\'uil le slatmhara \'e
Dh\'a loirge chaola
Is mura nd\'eanfadh s\'e ansin \'e
Ni dh\'eanfadh s\'e cho\'iche \'e

<b><u>Bail Inbhir Aora</b></u>(G\`aidhlig):
<u>S\`eist:</u>
Bha mi air banais am Bail' Inbhir Aora,
Bha mi air banais am Bail' Inbhir Aora,
Chaidh mi gu Banais le cuideachd a m' bhaile
'S gnu d'fhuir mi mo leannan am Bail' Inbhir Aora

'Sa mhadainn mun d'fh\`ag mi bi earail mo mh\`athair:
"Bi stuama, bi cairdeil, nad n\`adur a' laochan;
rach sgiobalta, sgoinneil 'nad eideadh  'nad anart
Mu 'm bi thu nad mhasladh dhomh 'm Bail' Inbhir Aora"

'N uair thog mi sinn ri bruthach gu h-uallagach, iollagach
\`Oigrigh air mhire, troimh fhireach is aonach
bu shunndach ar caithream than m\`ointeach is ghleannan,
'S piob a toirt langan air 'Bail Inbhir Aora.'

'N uair th\`oisich an dannsadh ri fidhill na deann-ruith
Cuir shi\`ubhlach gum b'fhonnar a pong-ghearradh aotrom;
Dh'fhogradh  gach smalan le s\`olas a' chaidr\`imh
Is b\`oidheach nan ainnir am Bail' Inbhir Aora.

<b><u>Miserable Old Man</b></u>:
I sent my old man
into the corner
drinking sour milk
and eating brown bread
If he stuck his head out
I'd take the nose off him
and give the rest of him
to the young girls

<u>Chorus</u>
Oh miserable old man, old man
I wish I had never married you
Oh miserable old man, old man
Lie on the bed and sleep your fill

If I were to find my old man
drowned in a bog hole
his legs broken,
and his shins wounded,
I'd take him home
and I'd stretch him out
and I'd walk on out
with the young fellows

If you could see my old man
around midnight
his feet on the hearth,
and him lighting his pipe
we'd look like a sea-rod
with his two skinny shins
and if he didn't do it then
he'd never do it

<b><u>The Inverary Wedding</u></b>:
<u>Chorus:</u>
I was at a wedding in Inverary
I was at a wedding in Inverary
I went to a wedding with people from my village,
and I got a girl in Inverary

In the morning before leaving, my mother's advice would be:
"Be sober, and friendly-natured, my boy
Go neatly, and smartly in your attire, your linen
so you won't be an embarresment to me in Inverary."

When we ascended the brae cheerily and light,
youths flirting through mountain and hill,
joyful was our cry over the moor and glen
with pipes roaring out '<i>Bail' Inbhir Aora!</i>'

When the dancing started with the fiddle at full pelt
belting out its cutting light notes,
every sorrow was vanquished with the joy of the company,
and the beauty of the maidens in Inverary!
