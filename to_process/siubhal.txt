Chunnaic mi 'n Coire haoi \`o,
deas 's i fo h-h-uidheam, ho ro!

Thog sinn a-mach air a' mhachair uaine,
dh'fhuar sinn a' Gharbhaird ghaibheachd, ghruamach
leum on iardheas s\`iontan cruaidh oirnn,
haoi \`o, 's i 'n Coire a bh'ann;

Thog i a ceann ri ceann nam fuarthonn,
's t\`e dhibh chaol, ni gaoir na gluasad,
thog i seinn is rinn i ruathar,
's i 'n Coire fh\`einn a bh'ann!

Chunnaic mi 'n Coire haoi \`o,
deas 's i fo h-h-uidheam, ho ro!

Sh\`in i a sg\`od le cruas na cruadhach,
Sh\`in i taobh ri taobh nam stuadhan
sh\`in i ceum a cheumadh chuantan
haoi \`o, 's i 'n Coire a bh'ann

Bhuail i beum le beul 's i tuairgneadh
thug i sad li sgar a guailne,
ghe\`arr i le\`on le sr\`oin 's i luasgan,
's i 'n Coire fh\`einn a bh'ann!

Chunnaic mi 'n Coire haoi \`o,
deas 's i fo h-h-uidheam, ho ro!

Eilean Aoidh, gum b'aoibh a nuallan,
Aird MhicLaomainn a gaoir gum b' uaibhreach,
Os cionn na h-Innse sheinn i duanag,
haoi \`o, 's i 'n Coire a bh'ann!

Cha robh nar s\`uileann ach sm\`uid a sr\`acan,
cathadh is siabhann o ch\`ir nam b\`airlinn,
cha robh nam cluais ach fuaim a st\`airneil,
's i 'n Coire fh\`ein a bh'ann!

I saw the Corrie, haoi o,
elegent in full sail, ho ro!

We made our way out across the green plain,
we weathered the tempestuous, gloomy Garvel,
hard squalls set upon us from the south west,
haoi o, it was the Corrie!

She raised her head against the cold wave heads,
the black slender one who wails as she moves,
she sang aloud and forged ahead,
it was the Corrie herself!

I saw the Corrie, haoi o,
elegent in full sail, ho ro!

She stretched her sheet with the rigidity of steel,
she stretched her flank to the flank of the waves,
she stretched her step to step over oceans,
haoi o, it was the Corrie,

She gave a whatch with her mouth, buffeting,
She struck a blow with the joint of her shoulder,
She carved out a gash with her nose as she rolled,
it was the Corrie herself!

I saw the Corrie, haoi o,
elegent in full sail, ho ro!

At Eilean Aoidh, joyful was her roaring,
at Ardlamont, her howling was haughty,
up off Inchmarnock she sang a ditty,
haoi o, it was the Corrie,

We could see only the smoke from her blows,
spindrift and spray from teh crest of the waves,
we could hear only the sound of her bellowing,
it was the Corrie herself!
