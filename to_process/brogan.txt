=====
Cha d\`ean na br\`ogan dannsaidh,
an gnothach idir idir dhomh,
'S olc na br\`ogan dannsaidh
Nach m\`aireadh idir dhomh-sa

Na br\`ogan fhuair mi an Dun-Phris
Ged a bha iad b\`oidheach piollach
thug mi 'n charraig iad gam milleadh,
'S gun d' rinn siud an str\`oiceadh
gun robh 'n gutta-percha dair dhomh
'S shaoil mi e' bhith saor ri cheannach
Thug e na builg air air mo bhuinn
'S bidh cuiumhn' agam ri m' bhe\`o air

Dh'\`eirich an t-uachdar on bhonn
'S bha m' \`ordag mh\`or air lim na d\`alach
Sgaoil na deireannan o n' s\`ailtean
'S rinn iad m' fh\`agail c\`omhla
Cha bhi mi coslach ri c\`ach
get th`\eid mi gu b\`al na banais
B'fh\`eirr dhomh 'n dibhearsain a chall
Na dannsadh le droch bhr\`ogan

Bha iad olc gu leum na f\`eitheadh
'S cha robh feum annt anns a charraid
'S dh'fheumainn fuireach fad on gr\`iosaich
Get ' bhriodh m' fheusag re\`odhte
Am fear a th\`ath ri ch\`eile 's tus iad
Cha toir mise turn dha tuilleadh
On a mheall e mi le foill
Gur ann a thoill e chorcach

Mur a dealaich e ri dh\`oigheann
Cha toir duine be\`o dha cuirean
Faodaidh e 'n doras a dh\`unadh
'S laigh 'n c\`uil na monadh
'N t-airgead a chruinnich mi fh\`in
A' reic nam b\`ioball anns gach baile
'S m\`or am milleadh air mo chli\`u
A thoirt do dhi\`u na gr\`oigean

The dancing shoes
won't do at all, at all
The dancing shoes are no use
the wouldn't last me at all

The shoes I got in Dumfries
although they were lovely and unusual looking
I took to the rocks with them and spoiled them
and that tore them to bits
and gutta-percha was expensive for me
and I thought it would be cheap
it gave me blisters on my soles
and I'll never forget it

The upper came away from the sole
and my big toe was sticking out
the heels split from the backs
and they both fell off me
I'll really stand out
if I go to the wedding dance
I'd prefer to miss out on all the fun
than dance with rubbish shoes

They were of no use on the moor
and they were no use when I got cold and tired
I would have to stay away from the fire
although my beard would be frozen 
the man who put them together in the first place
I'll never give him a turn again
Since he decieved me with his treachery
he deserves bad luck

If he doesn't change his ways
no-one will give him a turn again
he can just shut the door
and lie out at the back of the moor
the money that I had saved up
selling bibles in every village
my reputation is spoiled for
having considered the botcher useful
