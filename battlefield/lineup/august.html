        Now westlin winds and slaught'ring guns
        <br/>
        Bring Autumn's pleasant weather;
        <br/>
        The moorcock springs on whirring wings
        <br/>
        Amang the blooming heather:
        <br/>
        Now waving grain, wide o'er the plain,
        <br/>
        Delights the weary farmer;
        <br/>
        And the moon shines bright, as I rove at night,
        <br/>
        To muse upon my charmer.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The partridge loves the fruitful fells,
        <br/>
        The plover loves the mountains;
        <br/>
        The woodcock haunts the lonely dells,
        <br/>
        The soaring hern the fountains:
        <br/>
        Thro' lofty groves the cushat roves,
        <br/>
        The path of man to shun it;
        <br/>
        The hazel bush o'erhangs the thrush,
        <br/>
        The spreading thorn the linnet.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Thus ev'ry kind their pleasure find,
        <br/>
        The savage and the tender;
        <br/>
        Some social join, and leagues combine,
        <br/>
        Some solitary wander:
        <br/>
        Avaunt, away! the cruel sway,
        <br/>
        Tyrannic man's dominion;
        <br/>
        The sportsman's joy, the murd'ring cry,
        <br/>
        The flutt'ring, gory pinion!
        <br/>
        <br/>
        But, Peggy dear, the ev'ning's clear,
        <br/>
        Thick flies the skimming swallow,
        <br/>
        The sky is blue, the fields in view,
        <br/>
        All fading-green and yellow:
        <br/>
        Come let us stray our gladsome way,
        <br/>
        And view the charms of Nature;
        <br/>
        The rustling corn, the fruited thorn,
        <br/>
        And ev'ry happy creature.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        We'll gently walk, and sweetly talk,
        <br/>
        Till the silent moon shine clearly;
        <br/>
        I'll grasp thy waist, and, fondly prest,
        <br/>
        Swear how I love thee dearly:
        <br/>
        Not vernal show'rs to budding flow'rs,
        <br/>
        Not Autumn to the farmer,
        <br/>
        So dear can be as thou to me,
        <br/>
        My fair, my lovely charmer!
