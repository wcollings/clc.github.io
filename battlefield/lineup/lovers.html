        Ah, Battles and wars
        <br/>
        Leave deep wounds and scars,
        <br/>
        deep wounds and long in the mending
        <br/>
        Where Reflecting upon
        <br/>
        All that is gone
        <br/>
        Life passes on til it's ending
        <br/>
        <br/>
        But pleasure and pain
        <br/>
        in our memories remain
        <br/>
        And by memories, our life will be measured
        <br/>
        And the time that we spend
        <br/>
        with lovers and friends
        <br/>
        is time we remember with pleasure
        <br/>
        <br/>
        So fill up your glass,
        <br/>
        to the future and past,
        <br/>
        in harmony, be determined:
        <br/>
        There's more friendship poured out,
        <br/>
        in a bottle of stout,
        <br/>
        than you'll find in statute or sermon.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I've heard all the old songs,
        <br/>
        of the rights and the wrongs,
        <br/>
        the prophets of doom and destruction
        <br/>
        streetcorner messiahs,
        <br/>
        political pariahs,
        <br/>
        up to their necks in corruption
        <br/>
        <br/>
        From the holy and wise,
        <br/>
        denial and lies,
        <br/>
        where innocent youth is foresaken
        <br/>
        I have watched the days end
        <br/>
        with lovers and friends,
        <br/>
        sorry to see the dawn breakin'
        <br/>
        <br/>
        So fill up your glass,
        <br/>
        to the future and past,
        <br/>
        in harmony, be determined:
        <br/>
        There's more friendship poured out,
        <br/>
        in a bottle of stout,
        <br/>
        than you'll find in statute or sermon.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        There are those who are certain
        <br/>
        that drinking and courtin'
        <br/>
        is a sure way to hell and damnation
        <br/>
        Well if that is to be,
        <br/>
        it would seem clear to me,
        <br/>
        their god has no sense of occasion.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        For to fulfil his plan,
        <br/>
        both woman and man
        <br/>
        bring forth each new generation
        <br/>
        and a bottle of stout,
        <br/>
        and a bit of a haut,
        <br/>
        surely appease procreation
        <br/>
        <br/>
        So fill up your glass,
        <br/>
        throw your arms round your lass
        <br/>
        in harmony, be determined:
        <br/>
        There's more friendship poured out,
        <br/>
        in a bottle of stout,
        <br/>
        than you'll find in statute or sermon.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        To the brashest and proudest,
        <br/>
        and them that shout loudest,
        <br/>
        It would appear that the par has been given.
        <br/>
        To berate and deride us,
        <br/>
        seperate and divide us
        <br/>
        all in their version of heaven
        <br/>
        <br/>
        But mountains and rivers will by far outlive us
        <br/>
        when our bones, into dust, they are witherin'
        <br/>
        there'll be lovers and friends,
        <br/>
        and they'll comprehend,
        <br/>
        the reason we're in this together.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        So fill up your glass,
        <br/>
        to the future and past,
        <br/>
        in harmony, be determined:
        <br/>
        There's more friendship poured out,
        <br/>
        in a bottle of stout,
        <br/>
        than you'll find in statute or sermon.
