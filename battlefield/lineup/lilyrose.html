        As I walked out,
        <br/>
        one evening so clear,
        <br/>
        a young man lamented the loss of his dear
        <br/>
        And as he lamented,
        <br/>
        full sore did he cry,
        <br/>
        "Alas I'm tormented, for love must I die!"
        <br/>
        <br/>
        "My dear and my jewel,
        <br/>
        my honey" says he,
        <br/>
        "would you let me gang wi' you,
        <br/>
        your sweetheart to be?
        <br/>
        My dear and my jewel,
        <br/>
        my honey" said he,
        <br/>
        "would you let me gang wi' you,
        <br/>
        your true love to be?"
        <br/>
        <br/>
        "Were I to say yes,
        <br/>
        I'd speak against my mind,
        <br/>
        for to say no, you'd think me unkind.
        <br/>
        To sit and say nothin', you'd say I was dumb.
        <br/>
        Take that for your answer, and go as you come!"
        <br/>
        <br/>
        "A pox on you, Sally,
        <br/>
        for you are unkind!
        <br/>
        You took the lily, left the red rose behind,
        <br/>
        But the lily will yellow,
        <br/>
        and the time will come soon,
        <br/>
        when the red rose will flourish
        <br/>
        in the sweet month of June"
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Some marry for beauty,
        <br/>
        but beauty soon fades,
        <br/>
        some marry for riches,
        <br/>
        get wild, [?] glades,
        <br/>
        but if I should marry,
        <br/>
        and plain you may see,
        <br/>
        the wee lass that's loyal
        <br/>
        is the darling for me.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        As I walked out,
        <br/>
        one evening so clear,
        <br/>
        a young man lamented the loss of his dear
        <br/>
        And as he lamented,
        <br/>
        full sore did he cry,
        <br/>
        "Alas I'm tormented, for love must I die!"
