  <p align="center">
   There was a weaver in the north, and oh but he was cruel
   <br/>
   The very first nicht when he was wed, he sat and he grat for gruel
   <br/>
   He sat and he grat for gruel, he couldnae want his gruel
   <br/>
   The very first nicht when he was wed, he sat and he grat for gruel
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There's nae a speen in a' the hoose fur tae sup your gruel
   <br/>
   The gairden spad'll dae wi' me for I maun hae my gruel
   <br/>
   For I maun hae my gruel, I cannae want my gruel
   <br/>
   The gairden spad'll dae wi' me for I maun hae my gruel
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There's nae a bowl in a' the hoose for tae sup your gruel
   <br/>
   The horse's troch'll dae wi' me for I maun hae my gruel
   <br/>
   For I maun hae my gruel, I cannae want my gruel
   <br/>
   The horse's troch'll dae wi' me for I maun hae my gruel
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She gaed ben the hoose for wine and cake and brocht them ben on a stool
   <br/>
   Go awa', go awa' wi' your folderols for I maun hae my gruel
   <br/>
   For I maun hae my gruel, I cannae want my gruel
   <br/>
   Go awa', go awa' wi' your folderols for I maun hae my gruel
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Come a' young lassies and listen tae me, and never merry a weaver
   <br/>
   The very first nicht when he was wed, he sat and he grat for gruel
   <br/>
   He sat and he grat for gruel, he couldnae want his gruel
   <br/>
   The very first nicht when he was wed, he sat and he grat for gruel
   <br/>
   He sat and he grat for gruel, he couldnae want his gruel
   <br/>
   The very first nicht when he was wed, he sat and he grat for gruel
  </p>
