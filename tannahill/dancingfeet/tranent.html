  <p align="center">
   The chevalier being void o' fear did march up Birsle Brae, man
   <br/>
   And through Tranent e'er he did stent as fast as he could gae, man
   <br/>
   While General Cope did taunt and mock wie many's a loud hurrah, man
   <br/>
   But e'er next morn proclaimed the cock we heard another craw, man
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The brave Lochiel, as I heard tell, led Cameron on in cloods, man
   <br/>
   The morning fair and clear the air, they loosed wie devilish thuds, man
   <br/>
   Doon guns they threw and swords they drew and soon did chase them aff, man
   <br/>
   On Seaton's craft they burst their chafts and gart them run like daft, man
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The bluff dragoons swore blood and oons, they'd mak' the rebels run, man
   <br/>
   And yet they flee when them they see and winnae fire a gun, man
   <br/>
   They turned their backs, the fit tae crack, such terror siezed them a', man
   <br/>
   Some wet their cheeks, some fyled their breeks, and some for fear did fa', man
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Smith made sic' haste, sae spurred his beast, 'twas little there he saw, man
   <br/>
   Tae Berwick rade and safely said the Scots were rebels a', man
   <br/>
   O'er Soutra Hill ere he stood still afore he tasted meat, man
   <br/>
   Lang may he brag o' his swift nag that bore him aff sae fleet, man
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But Gardner brave did still behave like to a hero bright, man
   <br/>
   His courage true, like him were few, that still despised flight, man
   <br/>
   A' for king and laws and country's cause in honors bed did fa', man
   <br/>
   His life, but not his courage, fled while he had breath tae draw, man
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   At yon thorn tree that you may see beneath the meadow mill, man
   <br/>
   There's many slain lie on the plain, the clans pursuing still, man
   <br/>
   Sic' unco whacks and deadly hacks, I never saw the likes, man
   <br/>
   Lost hands and heids cost them their deeds that fell near Preston Dyke, man
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
