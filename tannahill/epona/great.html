  <p align="center">
   In the city of Glesga 'twas aye oan the kerds
   <br/>
   If ye lived near the river ye'd work in the yerds
   <br/>
   The first thing I saw when I opened my eyes
   <br/>
   Were the muckle great cranes that reached up tae the skies
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus (after each verse)
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Where we built the great ships of iron and steel
   <br/>
   The Lizzies, the Mary, we built them right here
   <br/>
   We built the great ships, the pride o' the sea
   <br/>
   And noo there is nae work for me
   <br/>
   And who wid believe that we built the great ships?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   At the end o' the forties apprenticed was I
   <br/>
   Tae the cream of the welders by the name o' MacKay
   <br/>
   "Ye've twa lugs and ane gob so listen, nae lip
   <br/>
   And I'll show youse young lads how we build the great ships"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   At the end o' the sixties the hale thing jist died
   <br/>
   We had marches an' work ins, my God, how we tried
   <br/>
   There was nae need for highly skilled craftsmen like me
   <br/>
   They build ships for damn all in Japan and Korea
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There's scarcely a ship and blessed few men
   <br/>
   As the river runs silent through Silicon Glen
   <br/>
   For an auld clapped oot welder ye'll no get much thanks
   <br/>
   Noo there's fish in the river and chips oan its banks
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Of iron and steel
   <br/>
   The Lizzies, the Mary, we built them right here
   <br/>
   We built the great ships, the pride o' the sea
   <br/>
   And noo there is nae work for me
   <br/>
   And who wid believe that we built the great ships?
  </p>
