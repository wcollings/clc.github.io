   I wish I were where Helen lies
   <br/>
   Night and day on me she cries
   <br/>
   Oh that I were where Helen lies
   <br/>
   On fair Kirkconnell lee
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh think ye na my heart was sair
   <br/>
   When my love dropt down and spake nae mair
   <br/>
   There did she swoon wi' meikle care
   <br/>
   On fair Kirkconnell lee
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Curst be the heart that thought the thought
   <br/>
   And curst the hand that fired the shot
   <br/>
   When in my arms burd Helen dropt
   <br/>
   And died to succour me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh that I were where Helen lies
   <br/>
   Night and day on me she cries
   <br/>
   Out of my bed she bids me rise
   <br/>
   Says, "Haste, and come to me"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh Helen fair, beyond compare
   <br/>
   I'll weave a garland of thy hair
   <br/>
   Shall bind my heart forever mair
   <br/>
   Until the day I dee
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I wish my grave were growing green
   <br/>
   A winding-sheet drawn o'er my een
   <br/>
   And I in Helen's arms lying
   <br/>
   On fair Kirkconnell lee
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh Helen fair, oh Helen chaste
   <br/>
   Were I with thee I would be blest
   <br/>
   Where thou lies low and takes thy rest
   <br/>
   On fair Kirkconnell lee
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I wish I were where Helen lies
   <br/>
   Night and day on me she cries
   <br/>
   And I am weary of the sky
   <br/>
   For her sake that died for me
  </p>
