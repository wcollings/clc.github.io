  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I must away, love, I can no longer tarry
   <br/>
   The morning tempest I have to cross
   <br/>
   I will be guided without a star, love
   <br/>
   Into the arms I love the best
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I walked up tae her bedroom windae
   <br/>
   I leant my back there against a stane
   <br/>
   I whispered softly intae her windae
   <br/>
   "My darling lassie, dae ye lie alane?"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She raised her head from her snowy pillow
   <br/>
   And with her arms raised across her breast
   <br/>
   Said, "Who is this at my bedroom windae
   <br/>
   Disturbing me at my long night's rest?"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I said, "My true love, it's your own true lover
   <br/>
   Open the door now and let me in
   <br/>
   For I have come on a long, long journey
   <br/>
   And I am drenched unto the skin"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She opened the door then without a murmur
   <br/>
   Opened the door then and let me in
   <br/>
   We gently kissed and embraced each other
   <br/>
   And in the morning we lay as yin
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The day was dawning, the cocks were crawing
   <br/>
   The birds were whistling in every tree
   <br/>
   Farewell, my true love, for I must leave ye
   <br/>
   For now the long night has turned to day
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I must away, love, I can no longer tarry
   <br/>
   The morning tempest I have to cross
   <br/>
   I will be guided without a star, love
   <br/>
   Into the arms I love the best
  </p>

  </cleaned>
