  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Awa' wi' Canada's muddy creeks and Canada's fields of pine
   <br/>
   This land of wheat's a goodly land, but oh it is not mine
   <br/>
   The heathy hill, the grassy dale, the daisy-spangled lea
   <br/>
   The purling burn and craggy linn old Scotland's glens give me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh I would like tae hear again the lark on Tinnie's hill
   <br/>
   Or see the wee bit gowanie that blooms beside the rill
   <br/>
   Like banished Swiss who views afar his Alps with longing e'e
   <br/>
   I gaze upon the morning star that shines on my country
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   No more I'll win by Eskdale Glen or Pentland's craggy combe
   <br/>
   Those days can ne'er come back again of thirty years that's gone
   <br/>
   But fancy oft ae midnight hour will steal across the sea
   <br/>
   And yester eve in a pleasant dream I saw the old country
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Each well-known scene that met my view brought childhood's joys to mind
   <br/>
   The blackbird sang on Tushie Linn, the song he sang, Lang Syne
   <br/>
   But like a dream time flies away, again the morning came
   <br/>
   And I awoke in Canada three thousand miles frae hame
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Awa' wi' Canada's muddy creeks and Canada's fields of pine
   <br/>
   This land of wheat's a goodly land, but oh it is not mine
   <br/>
   The heathy hill, the grassy dale, the daisy-spangled lea
   <br/>
   The purling burn and craggy linn old Scotland's glens give me
  </p>
