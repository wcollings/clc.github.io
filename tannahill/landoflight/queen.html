     Lyrics

  </p>
  <p align="center">
   As I roved out one fine summer morn
   <br/>
   'Mang lofty hills, moorlands and mountains
   <br/>
   Wha should I spy but a fair young maid
   <br/>
   As I wi' others was out a-hunting
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   No shoes nor stockings did she wear
   <br/>
   And neither had she cap nor feather
   <br/>
   But her golden hair hung in ringlets fair
   <br/>
   The gentle breeze blew 'round her shoulders
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I said, "Braw lass, why roam your lane?
   <br/>
   Why roam your lane amang the heather?"
   <br/>
   She said, "My father's awa' frae hame
   <br/>
   And I'm herding a' his yowes thegether"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I said, "Braw lass, gin ye'll be mine
   <br/>
   And care tae lie in a bed o' feather
   <br/>
   In silks and satins you will shine
   <br/>
   Ye'll be my queen amang the heather"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She said, "Kind sir, your offer's fine
   <br/>
   But I'm afraid 'twas meant for laughter
   <br/>
   For I see you are some rich squire's son
   <br/>
   I am but a poor shepherd's daughter"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "But had ye been a shepherd loon
   <br/>
   Herding yowes in yonder valley
   <br/>
   Or had ye been the plooman's son
   <br/>
   Wi' a' my heart I could a' loo'd ye"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I've been tae balls and I've been tae halls
   <br/>
   I've been tae London and Balquidder
   <br/>
   But the bonniest lass that e'er I saw
   <br/>
   Was herding yowes amang the heather
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
