  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The maidens are smiling in rocky Glencoe
   <br/>
   The clansmen are arming to rush on the foe
   <br/>
   Their banners are streaming as forth leaves the clan
   <br/>
   And the yellow-haired laddie is first in the band
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The pibroch is kindling their hearts to the war
   <br/>
   Cameron's slogans are heard from afar
   <br/>
   They close for the struggle where many shall fall
   <br/>
   And the yellow-haired laddie is the foremost of all
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He towers on the wave like a wild, rolling tide
   <br/>
   No kinsman of valiance will stand by his side
   <br/>
   The Camerons gather around him alone
   <br/>
   He heeds not the danger, and fear is unknown
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The plumes o' his bonnet are seen in the fight
   <br/>
   Those beacons of valor, they light with his sight
   <br/>
   But his sword and his claymore are greater distressed
   <br/>
   For the plumes o' his bonnet now lie in the dust
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The maidens are weeping in rocky Glencoe
   <br/>
   From warriors' eyelids those bitter tears flow
   <br/>
   Where, tell me, where is our chieftain so dear?
   <br/>
   And the yellow-haired laddie lies low on the brae
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
