     Lyrics
    </u>
    :
   </b>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The humpback, the bowhead, the blue and the gray
   <br/>
   The right whale, the spermwhale have near had their day
   <br/>
   Yet here in their twilight there must be a way
   <br/>
   To bring the kings back tae the ocean
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It's five thousand years they've been hunted and chased
   <br/>
   From the warm Bay of Biscay to the Antarctic waste
   <br/>
   Oft times to make shapely those ladies of taste
   <br/>
   Whose perfume brought death tae the ocean
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   The seven seas are deep and wide
   <br/>
   Four ancient winds blow restlessly
   <br/>
   There's neither peace nor place to hide
   <br/>
   All for your bustles and bonnets
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Gone are the days of the kayak and spear
   <br/>
   The old sailing ships when a sailor knew fear
   <br/>
   The harpoon explodes and the cannon's the gear
   <br/>
   Wreaks the death some would still call a harvest
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   No more are the days when we netted and hauled
   <br/>
   The factory ships slaughter what floats, swims or crawls
   <br/>
   The law of the sea now is leave bugger all
   <br/>
   To reap without sowing's the fashion
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But for every vessel that weathered the gale
   <br/>
   Tossed like a cork between harpoon and whale
   <br/>
   It's you shall be free and you'll flourish your tail
   <br/>
   Once more to be king of the ocean
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Damn all your bustles and bonnets
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
 </body>
