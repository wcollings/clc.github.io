  <p align="center">
   I'm a rovin' heilandman, a native o' Braemar
   <br/>
   And oft I've trod the bonnie hills, I'm kenned baith near and far
   <br/>
   In monies the lonely valley folk ken Jock Brewer's name
   <br/>
   Now I'm bound across the ocean far frae my native hame
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   At the Birk o' Ballater my gun in tae my hand
   <br/>
   I quickly was surrounded by six keepers in a band
   <br/>
   They thocht they had me taken but little did they know
   <br/>
   Jock Brewer the rovin' heilandman would prove their overthrow
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Ae nicht I was trepanded by six keepers head in sand
   <br/>
   They marched me off tae Aiberdeen my trial for tae stand
   <br/>
   Though nane o' my companions bore witness against me
   <br/>
   The judge, he has condemned me tae cross the raging sea
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Here's a health tae a' my comrades Jock Brewer winnae name
   <br/>
   Success untae a' poachers when they're in search of game
   <br/>
   May they a' be aye at liberty tae choose tae fecht or flee
   <br/>
   Or tae join the rovin' heilandman condemned tae cross the sea
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Here's a health tae a' my comrades, tae poachers far and near
   <br/>
   May they aye get hare and pheasant and their share o' bonnie deer
   <br/>
   May they a' be aye at liberty wi' money at their command
   <br/>
   Or tae join the rovin' heilandman bound for Van Diemans land
  </p>
