  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When this world was younger, I fished the ocean sae deep and wide
   <br/>
   But noo these days are flotsam and washed up wi' the tide
   <br/>
   I sit hame starin' at the fire, too young tae gledly be retired
   <br/>
   And mind on a' they guid days before we had tae say
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Fareweel, ye silver darlins
   <br/>
   Nae mair we'll trawl those North Sea shoals
   <br/>
   We left the auld girl in the harbor
   <br/>
   Nae mair tae feel the ocean's roll
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   My faither worked the trawlers, his auld man did the very same
   <br/>
   For a' the fowk in this toon, the fishin' was their game
   <br/>
   A way of life grew auld and gray, the young move oot or waste away
   <br/>
   They've never kenned the guid times before we had tae say
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When this world was younger, the hale toon worked on this empty quay
   <br/>
   The fleet streetched oot afore me as faur as I could see
   <br/>
   Noo at the harbor I maun staun and count the ships on baith my hauns
   <br/>
   And mind on a' they guid times before we had tae say
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus 2x)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Aye noo the harbor's empty like a' the poackets in this auld toon
   <br/>
   The government will help ye, aye we'll a' flee tae the moon
   <br/>
   And noo the streets in front o' me are deid just like the very sea
   <br/>
   What happened tae the guid days before we had tae say
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There's rules and regulations and laws that naebody understands
   <br/>
   They're fishing here frae a' place, but we must bide on land
   <br/>
   Some o' us still earn a crust while other boats just turn tae rust
   <br/>
   And mind on a' they guid days before we had tae say
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus 2x)
  </p>
 </body>
