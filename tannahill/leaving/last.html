   Last May a braw wooer cam' down the lang glen
   <br/>
   And sair wi' his love he did deave me
   <br/>
   I said there was naethin' I hated like men
   <br/>
   The deuce gae wi' him to believe me, believe me
   <br/>
   The deuce gae wi' him to believe me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He spak o' the darts in my bonnie blue een
   <br/>
   And vowed for my love he was diein'
   <br/>
   I said he might die when he wanted for Jean
   <br/>
   The Lord forgie me for liein', for liein'
   <br/>
   The Lord forgie me for liein'
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   A weel-stocket mailin, himsel for the laird
   <br/>
   And marriage off hand were his proffers
   <br/>
   I never loot on that I kenned it or cared
   <br/>
   But thought I might hae waur offers, waur offers
   <br/>
   But thought I might hae waur offers
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But what wad ye think? In a fortnight or less
   <br/>
   The de'il tak his taste to gae near her
   <br/>
   He up the Gate-Slack to my black cousin Bess
   <br/>
   Guess ye how the jad, I could bear her, could bear her
   <br/>
   Guess ye how the jad, I could bear her
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But a' the niest week as I petted wi' care
   <br/>
   I gaed to the tryste o' Dalgarnock
   <br/>
   And wha but my fine fickle lover was there?
   <br/>
   I glower'd as I'd seen a warlock, a warlock
   <br/>
   I glower'd as I'd seen a warlock
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But owre my left shouther I gied him a blink
   <br/>
   Lest neebours might say I was saucy
   <br/>
   My wooer, he capered as he'd been in drink
   <br/>
   And vowed I was his dear lassie, dear lassie
   <br/>
   And vowed I was his dear lassie
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I spiered for my cousin fu' couthy and sweet
   <br/>
   Gin she had recovered her hear'n
   <br/>
   And how her new shoon fit her auld shackled feet
   <br/>
   But heavens, how he fell a-swearin', a-swearin'
   <br/>
   But heavens, how he fell a-swearin'
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He begged, for gudesake, I wad be his wife
   <br/>
   Or else I wad kill him wi' sorrow
   <br/>
   So e'en to preserve the poor body in life
   <br/>
   I think I maun wed him tomorrow, tomorrow
   <br/>
   I think I maun wed him tomorrow
  </p>
