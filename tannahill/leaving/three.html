  <p align="center">
   To ane king and nae king, ane uncle and father
   <br/>
   To him that's all these yet allowed to be neither
   <br/>
   Come push it aboot while the bottle's our standard
   <br/>
   If you'd know what I mean, it's a health to our landlord
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   To ane queen and nae queen, ane aunt and nae mother
   <br/>
   Come, boys, let us cheerfully drink off another
   <br/>
   And now to be honest we'll stick by our faith, sir
   <br/>
   And stand by our landlord as long as we've breath, sir
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   To ane prince and nae prince, ane son and nae bastard
   <br/>
   Beshrew him that say it, a lie that is fostered
   <br/>
   God bless them all three, we'll conclude with this one, sir
   <br/>
   Here's a health to our landlord, his wife and his son, sir
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   To our monarch's return one more we'll advance, boys
   <br/>
   We've one that's in Flanders, the other's in France, boys
   <br/>
   Then aboot with the health, let him come, let him come then
   <br/>
   Send the wan into England, and both are at home then
  </p>
