  <p align="center">
   Wha will ride wi' gallant Murray?
   <br/>
   Wha will ride for Geordie's sel'?
   <br/>
   He's the flower o' Glen Isla
   <br/>
   And the darlin' o' Dunkeld
   <br/>
   See the white rose in his bonnet
   <br/>
   See his banner o'er the Tay
   <br/>
   His guid sword he now has drawn it
   <br/>
   And has flung his sheath away
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Every faithfu' Murray follows
   <br/>
   First of heroes, best of men
   <br/>
   Every true and trusty Stewart
   <br/>
   Blythely leaves his native glen
   <br/>
   Athol lads are lads of honor
   <br/>
   Westland rogues are rebels a'
   <br/>
   When we come within their border
   <br/>
   We may gar the Campbell's claw
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Menzies, he's our friend and brother
   <br/>
   Gask and Strowan are nae slack
   <br/>
   Noble Perth has ta'en the field
   <br/>
   And a' the Drummonds at his back
   <br/>
   Let us ride wi' gallant Murray
   <br/>
   Let us fight for Charlie's crown
   <br/>
   From the right we'll never sinder
   <br/>
   'Til we bring the tyrants down
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   MacIntosh, the gallant sodger
   <br/>
   Wi' the Grahams and Gordons gay
   <br/>
   They have ta'en the field of honor
   <br/>
   Spite of all their chiefs could say
   <br/>
   Bend the musket point the rapier
   <br/>
   Shift the brog for Lowland shoe
   <br/>
   Scour the durk and face the danger
   <br/>
   MacIntosh has all to do
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Wha will ride wi' gallant Murray?
   <br/>
   Wha will ride for Geordie's sel'?
   <br/>
   He's the flower o' Glen Isla
   <br/>
   And the darlin' o' Dunkeld
   <br/>
   See the white rose in his bonnet
   <br/>
   See his banner o'er the Tay
   <br/>
   His guid sword he now has drawn it
   <br/>
   And has flung his sheath away
  </p>
