  <p align="center">
   Noo in Perth there lived a bonnie lad, a brewer tae his trade O
   <br/>
   And he has courted Peggy Roy, a young and handsome maid O
   <br/>
   He's courted her for seven years, a' for tae gain her favor
   <br/>
   There came a lad oot Glesca toon wha' swore that he wad hae her
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus (after each verse)
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   And will ye come alang wi' me and will ye be my honey?
   <br/>
   And will ye come alang wi' me and leave your brewer laddie?
   <br/>
   They've rambled up, they've rambled doon, they've rambled through Kirkcaldy
   <br/>
   And monies the nicht she's rued the day she left her brewer laddie
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The brewer lad cam' hame at een enquiring for his honey
   <br/>
   Her faither, he made this reply, "She's no been here since Sunday"
   <br/>
   "If that be so, then let her go and I will never grieve her
   <br/>
   I'm a lad that's free as you can see, a sma' thing will relieve her"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There's just as guid fish in the sea as ever yet was taken
   <br/>
   I'll cast my line and try again, you're only once forsaken
   <br/>
   The Glesca fellah's up and gane, the country he has fled O
   <br/>
   He's left nae sark upon her back nor blanket on her bed O
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The brewer lad still lives in Perth and there he brews guid ale-o
   <br/>
   And he has found another lass and taen her tae his bed O
   <br/>
   Ye lovers a', where e'er ye be, just let this be fair warnin'
   <br/>
   Never slight your ain true love for fear ye get a' waur ane
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
