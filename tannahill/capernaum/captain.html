   Come, all ye jolly mariners
   <br/>
   That love to tak' a dram
   <br/>
   I'll tell ye o' a robber
   <br/>
   That o'er the sea did come
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He wrote a letter tae the king
   <br/>
   On the eleventh of July
   <br/>
   To see if he wad accept o' him
   <br/>
   For his jovial company
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Na, na," says the king
   <br/>
   "Oh that can never be
   <br/>
   They tell me ye're a robber
   <br/>
   A robber on the sea"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He has built a bonnie ship
   <br/>
   An' sent her tae the sea
   <br/>
   Wi' fower and twenty mariners
   <br/>
   To man his bonnie ship wi'
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   An' they sailed up, an' they sailed doon
   <br/>
   Sae stately, blythe an' free
   <br/>
   'Til they spied the king's high Reindeer
   <br/>
   Like a leviathan on the sea
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Why sit there, ye tinker
   <br/>
   Ye silly coordly thief?
   <br/>
   Why lie there, ye tinker
   <br/>
   An' hold oor king in grief?"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   They fought from one in the morning
   <br/>
   'Til it was six at night
   <br/>
   Until the king's high Reindeer
   <br/>
   Was forced to tak' her flight
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Gae hame, gae hame, ye tinkers
   <br/>
   Tell ye your king fae me
   <br/>
   Though he reign king upon good dry land
   <br/>
   I will reign king upon sea
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Come, all ye jolly mariners
   <br/>
   That love to tak' a dram
