   'Twas in the month of August when the yellow grew the corn
   <br/>
   The hills, they were a' darkened and the heather a' in bloom
   <br/>
   I roved aboot frae toon tae toon tae see the lassies braw
   <br/>
   Though my auld aged parents lived in fair Gallowa'
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Then intae Glasgow toon I came and doon upon a green
   <br/>
   Where a' the bonnie lassies fair were there for to be seen
   <br/>
   And there was ane amang the rest, the flooer amang them a'
   <br/>
   The sweetest face in a' the place or yet in Gallowa'
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I stepped up unto her for tae ask at her the way
   <br/>
   Unto a place I knew richt weel tae hear what she might say
   <br/>
   "Ye seem tae be a stranger lad, wi' me ye'll come awa'
   <br/>
   And I will show you straight the way doon by the Broomielaw"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I courted this fair lassie by the night and by the day
   <br/>
   Until the time was drawing near that I must go away
   <br/>
   "I'll leave it to your choice, my dear, tae come or stay awa'
   <br/>
   Or paddle on the road wi' me tae fair Gallowa'"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I turned me then aroon' aboot as for tae go away
   <br/>
   Sae strang as she invited me tae stay anither day
   <br/>
   This couple, they've got married noo and live thegether braw
   <br/>
   And noo she lives a happy life in fair Gallowa'
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   'Twas in the month of August when the yellow grew the corn
   <br/>
   The hills, they were a' darkened and the heather a' in bloom
   <br/>
   I roved aboot frae toon tae toon tae see the lassies braw
   <br/>
   Though my auld aged parents lived in fair Gallowa'
