    Chorus

   <br/>
   It's ower the hills and faur awa'
   <br/>
   It's ower the hills and faur awa'
   <br/>
   It's ower the hills and faur awa'
   <br/>
   The wind has blawn my plaid awa'
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Jocky met with Jeannie fair between the dawnin' and the day
   <br/>
   But Jocky noo is fu' o' care since Jenny's stown his heart away
   <br/>
   Although she promised tae be true, she proven has, alas, unkind
   <br/>
   The which does make poor Jocky rue that e'er he lo'ed a fickle mind
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Jocky was a bonnie lad that e'er was born in Scotia fair
   <br/>
   But noo, poor lad, he does run mad syne Jenny causes his dispair
   <br/>
   Young Jocky was a piper's son, he fell in love when he was young
   <br/>
   And a' the tunes that he could play was ower the hills and far awa'
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When first I saw my Jeannie's face, she seemed sae fair, sae fu' o' grace
   <br/>
   Wi' miekle joy my heart was filled, that's noo alas what sorrow killed
   <br/>
   Oh were she but as true as fair, 'twid put an end tae my dispair
   <br/>
   Instead o' that, she is unkind and wavers like the winter wind
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Hard was my hap tae fa' in love wi' ane that does sae faithless prove
   <br/>
   Hard was my fate tae court a maid wha has my constant heart betrayed
   <br/>
   Since she is faus wha I adore, ne'er will I trust a woman more
   <br/>
   From a' their charms I'll flee awa', and on my pipes I'll sweetly play
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus 2x)
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
