  <p align="center">
   Spirit moving, living, breathing
   <br/>
   Healing motion, feeling devotion
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Under the desert sun
   <br/>
   Two hearts beat as one
   <br/>
   Rhythm of the living drum
   <br/>
   Milking the cow
   <br/>
   Pray for the rain to come
   <br/>
   Blessings from the one
   <br/>
   Milking the cow
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Behold the shifting sand
   <br/>
   The riches of our land
   <br/>
   Life flows through our hands
   <br/>
   Milking the cow
   <br/>
   Beneath the darkened sky
   <br/>
   Hear the spirit cry
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   To milk the cow is to praise the hand of God that moves before us
   <br/>
   To feed the cow is to worship the spirit that breathes within us
   <br/>
   To kill the cow is to accept the darkness deep within us
   <br/>
   To spurn the cow is to spurn the gift of God that gives us life
   <br/>
   Milk the cow and feel the rhythm that beats inside us
   <br/>
   Touch the cow and feel the spirit that moves within us
   <br/>
   Kill the cow and feel the sorrow that lies before us
   <br/>
   In blood we are born, blood of the cow redeems us
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Spirit moving, living, breathing
   <br/>
   Healing motion, feeling devotion
