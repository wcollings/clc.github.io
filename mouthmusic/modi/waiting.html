  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When I first came to this town
   <br/>
   I was a traveller without a guide
   <br/>
   When I first came to this town
   <br/>
   I was as proud as the road was wide
   <br/>
   When I first saw you walk by
   <br/>
   I felt a fire burn in me
   <br/>
   As I watched you walking by
   <br/>
   How could I explain the fever in me?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When you held me in your arms
   <br/>
   I thought the world had ceased to turn
   <br/>
   As you held me in your arms
   <br/>
   So did the fire slowly burn
   <br/>
   But my soul drifted away
   <br/>
   Searching for fields and pastures new
   <br/>
   My soul drifted away
   <br/>
   Never at peace in the world I knew
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And there's no waiting worth the misery
   <br/>
   And there's no wanting worth the tears
   <br/>
   And there's no searching for a mystery
   <br/>
   And there's no innocence at the heart of me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Many oceans I have crossed
   <br/>
   Hoping to feel again the need in me
   <br/>
   Love's a gamble that we've lost
   <br/>
   Nothing remains as it used to be
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And there's no waiting worth the misery
   <br/>
   And there's no wanting worth the tears
   <br/>
   And there's no searching for a mystery
   <br/>
   And there's no innocence at the heart of me
   <br/>
   (2x)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I may want to stay some day...
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I will want to stay some day...
  </p>
