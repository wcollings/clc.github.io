  <p align="center">
   Evergreen, hear their song
   <br/>
   Root and branch, grow them strong
   <br/>
   Shadows fall, see them long
   <br/>
   Wise man, listen to the forest song
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Grow them broad, grow them long
   <br/>
   Grow them tall, grow them strong
   <br/>
   Shadows fall, see them long
   <br/>
   Wise man, listen to the forest song
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Leaves of green and roots of men
   <br/>
   Let the forest breathe again
   <br/>
   From Birnam Wood to Dunsinane
   <br/>
   Let the forest walk again
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Who's lighting the fires that burn them down?...
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Grow them broad, grow them long
   <br/>
   Grow them tall, grow them strong
   <br/>
   Shadows fall, see them long
   <br/>
   Wise man, listen to the forest song
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   At the hand of man, see them burn
   <br/>
   Who's lighting the fires that burn?
   <br/>
   Life blood never return
   <br/>
   Who's lighting the fires that burn?
   <br/>
   At the hand of man, see them fall
   <br/>
   Who's lighting the fires that burn?
   <br/>
   Wise man, listen to the forest call
   <br/>
   Why don't you listen to the forest call?
   <br/>
   The fires that burn them down
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Leaves of green and roots of men
   <br/>
   Let the forest breathe again
   <br/>
   From Birnam Wood to Dunsinane
   <br/>
   Let the forest walk again
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Who's fighting the fires that burn?
   <br/>
   Steel wheels move, you can feel them turn
   <br/>
   Ripped from the earth, your roots will tear
   <br/>
   The sound of rending flesh fills the air
   <br/>
   In fire and searing heat, your body's burned
   <br/>
   Consumed in flames, your ashes spurned
   <br/>
   The wind blows, the rain falls, no time to pause
   <br/>
   A desert lies where your life once was
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You stood by and waited for your turn so now
   <br/>
   Who's lighting the fires that burn?
   <br/>
   You stood by and waited for your turn so now
   <br/>
   Who's lighting the fires that burn them down?
   <br/>
   You stood by and waited for your turn so now
   <br/>
   Who's lighting the fires that burn?
   <br/>
   You stood by and waited for your turn
   <br/>
   The fires that burn
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   At the hand of man, see them burn
   <br/>
   Who's lighting the fires that burn?
   <br/>
   Life blood never return
   <br/>
   Who's lighting the fires that burn?
   <br/>
   At the hand of man, see them fall
   <br/>
   Who's lighting the fires that burn?
   <br/>
   Wise man, listen to the forest call
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Leaves of green and roots of men
   <br/>
   Let the forest breathe again
   <br/>
   From Birnam Wood to Dunsinane
   <br/>
   Let the forest walk again
