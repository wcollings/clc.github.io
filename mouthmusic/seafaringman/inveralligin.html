  </p>
  <p align="center">
   His bright eyes he got from his mother
   <br/>
   The way he smiles, a gift from his father
   <br/>
   The world on his shoulders
   <br/>
   He learned from the rocks of Inveralligin
   <br/>
   But his darkened heart, his heart is his alone
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   How can the same sun shine on him
   <br/>
   Yet he remain colder than the air around him?
   <br/>
   How can the shelter of thses purple hills
   <br/>
   Yet leave him open to the forces of eternal winds?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   How can they say, "Like father, like son"?
   <br/>
   They stand together and there is no likeness
   <br/>
   How can I share my life with him
   <br/>
   While so much misfortune plays around his face?
   <br/>
   I would be foolish indeed
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
