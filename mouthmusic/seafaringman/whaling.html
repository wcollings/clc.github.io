  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And in her heart she knows that he would defend her
   <br/>
   And travel far and wide to be by her side
   <br/>
   And calling out his name, she longs for the winter
   <br/>
   And for the day that he would walk up the lane
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   For he's away on a whaling ship
   <br/>
   For he's away on a whaling ship
   <br/>
   And it was bound for Greenland
   <br/>
   For he's away on a whaling ship
   <br/>
   For he's away on a whaling ship
   <br/>
   And it was bound for Greenland
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And on a whaling vessel he set sail from her
   <br/>
   She hid her tears from him and laughed at the rain
   <br/>
   But now the earth is dry and the acres untended
   <br/>
   And many thieves and outlaws walk up the lane
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   For he's away on a whaling ship
   <br/>
   For he's away on a whaling ship
   <br/>
   And it was bound for Greenland...
  </p>
