  </p>
  <p align="center">
   See them standing on the corner
   <br/>
   Little boys with so much anger
   <br/>
   Handing out their bits of paper
   <br/>
   Black on white, oh what a caper
   <br/>
   They make a stand, they say it's right
   <br/>
   Forcing others up to fight
   <br/>
   Join their army of little people
   <br/>
   Here's the church, but where's the steeple?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   At the altar they do preach
   <br/>
   Then brown their bodies on the beach
   <br/>
   They say one thing but mean another
   <br/>
   Then decide to take it further
   <br/>
   Arm outstretched they keep the score
   <br/>
   War is love and love is war
   <br/>
   So here am I between two evils
   <br/>
   Blue sea beckons in the devil
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   World is for all...
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Little men with too much power
   <br/>
   Standing in ivory tower
   <br/>
   Take what the want from a culture
   <br/>
   They steal your soul but they don't want you
   <br/>
   Casting sticks and throwing stones
   <br/>
   They pledge allegiance to their throne
   <br/>
   But soon enough they'll lose their crown
   <br/>
   And I'll watch their house come tumbling down
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   World is for all...
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Do I fit? Do I belong?
   <br/>
   Am I right or am I wrong?
   <br/>
   To think that we could live together
   <br/>
   Birds of a feather
   <br/>
   This severed bridge, this broken link
   <br/>
   Communication is not in sync
   <br/>
   Who will win this tribal warfare?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   World is for all...
  </p>
