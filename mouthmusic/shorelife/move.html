   We're moving on in life...
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Spirit, come be with me, see with mine eyes
   <br/>
   Spirit, come walk with me, be my disguise
   <br/>
   Spirit, some speak with me words I would know
   <br/>
   Spirit, come move with me where'er I go
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And move on, we're moving on in life...
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Spirit, come roam with me, restless this heart
   <br/>
   Spirit, come stay with me, never we'll part
   <br/>
   Spirit, come spin with me, dance if you dare
   <br/>
   Spirit, come move with me where'er I fare
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And move on, we're moving on in life...
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Spirit, come be with me, be with me, be with me
   <br/>
   Spirit, come walk with me, walk with me, walk with me
   <br/>
   Spirit, some speak with me, speak with me, speak with me
   <br/>
   Spirit, come move with me, move with me, move with me...
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And move on, we're moving on in life...
