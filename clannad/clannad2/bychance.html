  <p align="center">
   By chance it was I met my love, it did me much surprise
   <br/>
   Down by a shady myrtle grove just as the sun did rise
   <br/>
   The birds, they sang right gloriously and pleasant was the air
   <br/>
   And there was none save she and I among the flowers fair
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   In dewy grass and green we walked, she timid was and coy
   <br/>
   How canst thou choose but pity me, my pretty pearl, my joy?
   <br/>
   "How comes it that thou stroll this way? Sweet maiden, tell me true
   <br/>
   Before bright Phoebus' glittering ray has supped the morning dew"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "I go to tend the flocks I love, the ewes and tender lambs
   <br/>
   That pasture by the myrtle grove, that gambol by their dams
   <br/>
   There I enjoy a pure content at dawning of the day"
   <br/>
   Then hand in hand we lovers went to see the flock at play
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And as we wended down the road I said to her, "Sweet maid
   <br/>
   Three years I in my place abode and three more must be stayed
   <br/>
   The three that I am bound so fast, oh fairest, wait for me
   <br/>
   And when the weary years are past, then wedded we will be"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Three years are long, three times too long, too lengthy the delay"
   <br/>
   And then I answered in my song, "Hope wastes them quick away
   <br/>
   Where love is fervent, fain and fast and knoweth not decay
   <br/>
   There nimbly fleet the seasons past accounted as one day"
  </p>
