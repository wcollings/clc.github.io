  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Bows and flows of angel hair
   <br/>
   And ice cream castles in the air
   <br/>
   And feather canyons everywhere
   <br/>
   I've looked at clouds that way
   <br/>
   But now they only block the sun
   <br/>
   They rain and snow on everyone
   <br/>
   So many things I would have done
   <br/>
   But clouds got in my way
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I've looked at clouds from both sides now
   <br/>
   From up and down and still somehow
   <br/>
   It's cloud illusions I recall
   <br/>
   I really don't know clouds at all
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
   <br/>
   The dizzy dancing way you feel
   <br/>
   As every fairy tale comes real
   <br/>
   I've looked at love that way
   <br/>
   But now it's just another show
   <br/>
   You leave 'em laughing when you go
   <br/>
   And if you care, don't let them know
   <br/>
   Don't give yourself away
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I've looked at love from both sides now
   <br/>
   From give and take and still somehow
   <br/>
   It's love's illusions I recall
   <br/>
   I really don't know love at all
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Tears and fears and feeling proud
   <br/>
   To say, "I love you" right out loud
   <br/>
   Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
   <br/>
   I've looked at life that way
   <br/>
   But now old friends are acting strange
   <br/>
   They shake their heads, they say I've changed
   <br/>
   But something's lost and something's gained
   <br/>
   In living every day
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I've looked at life from both sides now
   <br/>
   From win and lose and still somehow
   <br/>
   It's life's illusions I recall
   <br/>
   I really don't know life at all
  </p>
