     Lyrics

  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It was on a fine summer's morning
   <br/>
   The birds sweetly tune on each bough
   <br/>
   And as I walked out for my pleasure
   <br/>
   I saw a maid milking a cow
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Her voice was so enchanting, melodious
   <br/>
   Left me quite unable to go
   <br/>
   My heart, it was loaded with sorrow
   <br/>
   For the pretty girl milking her cow
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Then to her I made my advances
   <br/>
   "Good morrow, most beautiful maid
   <br/>
   Your beauty my heart so entrances"
   <br/>
   "Pray, sir, do not banter," she said
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "I'm not such a rare precious jewel
   <br/>
   That I should enamor you so
   <br/>
   I am but a poor little milk girl"
   <br/>
   Says the pretty girl milking her cow
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "The Indies afford no such jewel
   <br/>
   So bright, so transparently clear
   <br/>
   Ah do not add flames to my funeral
   <br/>
   Consent but to know me, my dear"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh had I the lamp of Aladdin
   <br/>
   Or the wealth that gold mines can bestow
   <br/>
   I would rather be poor in a cottage
   <br/>
   With the pretty girl milking her cow
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
