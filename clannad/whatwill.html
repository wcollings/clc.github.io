   There I go saying the same old things
   <br/>
   Something to rhyme or to cling to
   <br/>
   When times were tough, I didn't say enough
   <br/>
   Like some sweet lines to say to you, relate to you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   What will I do without you?
   <br/>
   What will I do? Heaven knows
   <br/>
   What will I do without you?
   <br/>
   What will I do?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We watch the seasons come and go
   <br/>
   Leaves are falling as water flows
   <br/>
   We took for granted the love that's wanted
   <br/>
   A leaning shoulder to cry on
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I don't know, I don't know
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Every day my heart will stray
   <br/>
   And dream of the memories we left behind
   <br/>
   Love is a reason, a reason to live
   <br/>
   So don't let it slip away
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   What will I do without you?
   <br/>
   What will I do?
   <br/>
   I don't know, I don't know
  </p>
