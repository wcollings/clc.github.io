  <p align="center">
   Broken pieces everywhere
   <br/>
   I still my mind and found I care
   <br/>
   Running on the morning tide
   <br/>
   Something you would say to me
   <br/>
   We drank the waters of delight
   <br/>
   We played the games of wrong and right
   <br/>
   Did we understand they're just footsteps in the sand?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh long dreaming, find my tears
   <br/>
   I could love you all the years
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There are times like today
   <br/>
   The wind will blow a gentle way
   <br/>
   Mark it down in frozen glass
   <br/>
   Lied to me that I could win
   <br/>
   So many ways to share a love
   <br/>
   With words and touch we promised much
   <br/>
   Do we understand the footsteps in the sand?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I believe, I believe too easily
   <br/>
   I believe, I believe too easily
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh long dreaming, find my tears
   <br/>
   I could love you all the years
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Here I stand still the same
   <br/>
   I dust the showcase, change the name
   <br/>
   Hard to know who plays the fool
   <br/>
   Never looking back on years
   <br/>
   I wonder now which way to face
   <br/>
   I catch a vision of this place
   <br/>
   Did we understand those footsteps in the sand?
  </p>
