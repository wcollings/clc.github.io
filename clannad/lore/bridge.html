   Time came around and I was in need
   <br/>
   You came by my side for my troubles to ease
   <br/>
   Collected my heart, healing the past
   <br/>
   You'll never lay down, I can count on you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We all speak well of a bridge
   <br/>
   That carries us over, over safe
   <br/>
   The art of compromise
   <br/>
   Has surely been our greatest strength
   <br/>
   Our greatest strength
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When someone pretends to circle your friends
   <br/>
   You'll find it's betrayal before it all ends
   <br/>
   A bittersweet chain that'll always remain
   <br/>
   So don't let illusions get the better of you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We all speak well of a bridge
   <br/>
   That carries us over, over safe
   <br/>
   The art of compromise
   <br/>
   Has been our greatest strength
   <br/>
   Our greatest strength
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Love is to share
   <br/>
   Where words can't compare
   <br/>
   Love is desire
   <br/>
   So full of fire
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We all speak well of a bridge
   <br/>
   That carries us over, over safe
   <br/>
   The art of compromise
   <br/>
   Has surely been our greatest strength
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We all speak well of a bridge
   <br/>
   That carries us over, over safe
   <br/>
   The art of compromise
   <br/>
   Has been our greatest strength
   <br/>
   Our greatest strength
  </p>
