   Hear a man with a wounded past
   <br/>
   While walking on I overheard
   <br/>
   He said he was right by being wrong
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Hear a man with a wounded child
   <br/>
   He lifted her and then she cried
   <br/>
   He said he was right by being strong
   <br/>
   He was right there all along
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He said he was right by being wrong
   <br/>
   He was right there all along
   <br/>
   The hunter
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The hunter, nothing but his might
   <br/>
   The hunter, nothing but a man
   <br/>
   The hunter...
  </p>
