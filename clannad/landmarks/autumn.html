   Autumn leaves are falling 'round us
   <br/>
   Time to gather all those many thoughts
   <br/>
   Of all the things that might have been
   <br/>
   Or gained at such a cost
   <br/>
   For some of us there's endless hoping
   <br/>
   For some of us a craziness, too
   <br/>
   Holding onto better reasons
   <br/>
   Works for me and you, you know it's true
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And when the stakes are higher
   <br/>
   Never play with fire
   <br/>
   Leave it alone
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I wandered through a country churchyard
   <br/>
   And wondered what kind of life they led
   <br/>
   Walked into a castle ruin
   <br/>
   Of gentry that had fled
   <br/>
   For some of them had endless hoping
   <br/>
   Some of them crazy, too
   <br/>
   Holding onto better reasons
   <br/>
   We'll never truly know
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Those trees will tumble down on a stormy day
   <br/>
   And those leaves will fade away, fade away
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The autumn leaves are falling 'round us
   <br/>
   I'm here to gather all my many thoughts
   <br/>
   Of all the things that might have been
   <br/>
   As the ground has turned to frost
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Leaves are falling, autumn leaves are falling...
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
