  </p>
  <p align="center">
   How gentle was the breeze that surrounded the way
   <br/>
   How loud the sea's roar on the four winds everyday
   <br/>
   Sharing love, wounded gifts from ancient long ago
   <br/>
   Together they closed in the circles we know
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Will we treasure all the secrets with life's changing scenes?
   <br/>
   Where our hearts were warm with love, so much love
   <br/>
   Will the flowers grow again as I open out my hand?
   <br/>
   Precious time, time for healing the beauty of this land
   <br/>
   (2x)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   How soulful those words that confuses the way
   <br/>
   How wild the mountains' stare as they guard our every day
   <br/>
   Take for granted noble hearts in the golden age that's flown
   <br/>
   Between us, recall on a strong road we've known
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Will we treasure all the secrets with life's changing scenes?
   <br/>
   Where our hearts were warm with love, so much love
   <br/>
   Will the flowers grow again as I open out my hand?
   <br/>
   Precious time, time for healing the beauty of this land
  </p>
