   Tell me what you please
   <br/>
   This place is a squeeze
   <br/>
   Your guess is as good as mine
   <br/>
   Sell me other dreams, oh the summer's here
   <br/>
   You know we're going down the line
   <br/>
   You know we're going down the line
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Taking all the pieces
   <br/>
   In the situation
   <br/>
   Hoping we can work it out
   <br/>
   With fate on your side, luck and some pride
   <br/>
   You are on the right line
   <br/>
   It'll be a sure sign
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   In fortune's hands
   <br/>
   Where do we stand
   <br/>
   In fortune's hand?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There isn't a noble
   <br/>
   Or a humble person
   <br/>
   Who isn't up or down a while
   <br/>
   Throw caution to the wind, leave your cares behind
   <br/>
   You know we're going down the line
   <br/>
   You know we're going down the line
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Tell me what you please
   <br/>
   This place is a squeeze
   <br/>
   Your guess is as good as mine
   <br/>
   Sell me other dreams 'cause the summer's here
   <br/>
   You know we're going down the line
   <br/>
   You know we're going down the line
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   In fortune's hands
   <br/>
   Where do we stand
   <br/>
   In fortune's hand?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   In fortune's hand...
  </p>
