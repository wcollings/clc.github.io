   <br/>
   Why must I worry?
   <br/>
   Try not to hurry like other people
   <br/>
   Why must I worry?
   <br/>
   'Cause you know yourself
   <br/>
   That is not the way
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Who am I to tell you lies
   <br/>
   And then say I didn't mean it at all?
   <br/>
   You see me, you hear me
   <br/>
   But you don't know what I'm saying
   <br/>
   You feel it, you take it in your stride
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When you call me
   <br/>
   And talk about the yesterdays
   <br/>
   It cheers me, it steers me
   <br/>
   To follow better reason
   <br/>
   To feel it, to take it in our stride
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Why worry, why worry?
   <br/>
   Try not to hurry, try not to hurry
   <br/>
   Why must I worry?
   <br/>
   'Cause you know yourself
   <br/>
   That is not my way
   <br/>
   Why must I worry?
   <br/>
   Try not to hurry, try not to hurry
   <br/>
   It's not the way
   <br/>
   Why worry?  Why worry?  Why worry?
   <br/>
   Try not to hurry
   <br/>
   Why must I worry? Why must I worry?
   <br/>
   It's not the way
