  <p align="center">
   Rising early out of bed, across the fields I steered O
   <br/>
   When oh and I, a woman I spied, a pretty fair maid appeared O
   <br/>
   Her head was bare, I do declare, she had neither hat nor feather on
   <br/>
   And she stooped so low, gave me to know it was mushrooms she was gathering O
   <br/>
   Oh gathering O, and she stooped so low, gave me to know
   <br/>
   It was mushrooms she was gathering O
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Where are you going?" says I, "My dear, why are you up so early O?
   <br/>
   I've seen you on the dewy grass before the sower early O"
   <br/>
   Quite modestly she answered me, and she gave her head one fetch up
   <br/>
   And she said, "I am gathering mushrooms to make my mammy ketchup O"
   <br/>
   Oh ketchup O, and she said, "I am gathering mushrooms
   <br/>
   To make my mammy ketchup O"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Her parting breast on mine she pressed, her heart was like a feather O
   <br/>
   And her lips on mine do gentle join and we both sat down together O
   <br/>
   Together O, and her lips on mine do gentle join
   <br/>
   And we both sat down together O
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Rising early out of bed, across the fields I steered O
   <br/>
   When oh and I, a woman I spied, a pretty fair maid appeared O
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
