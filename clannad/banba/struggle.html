   Traveling down a dirty road
   <br/>
   Covered with moss and see the gray stones
   <br/>
   Green as luscious fields in sight
   <br/>
   A dark moonlit night
   <br/>
   When the past flashes by
   <br/>
   Coming from the heavens like a falling star
   <br/>
   That you wish upon
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Isn't it a struggle to find a good friend?
   <br/>
   Isn't it a struggle to have to defend?
   <br/>
   Isn't it a struggle?
   <br/>
   You have to take that chance to lend a hand
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, I'm traveling down a dirty road
   <br/>
   Clearing up all that's known
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   A misty occurrence happens all the time
   <br/>
   Around every corner a brighter day lies
   <br/>
   Loads of mercy, beauty beholds
   <br/>
   An eye for a partner as good, as good as gold
   <br/>
   Green as luscious fields in sight
   <br/>
   A dark moonlit night
   <br/>
   When the past flashes by
   <br/>
   Coming from the heavens like a falling star
   <br/>
   That you wish upon
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Isn't it a struggle to find a good friend?
   <br/>
   Isn't it a struggle to have to defend?
  </p>

  </cleaned>
