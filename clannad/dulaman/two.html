  <p align="center">
   There were two sisters side by side
   <br/>
   Sing I-dum, sing I-day
   <br/>
   There were two sisters side by side
   <br/>
   The boys are born for me
   <br/>
   There were two sisters side by side
   <br/>
   The eldest for young Johnny cried
   <br/>
   I'll be true unto my love if he'll be true to me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Johnny bought the youngest a gay-gold ring
   <br/>
   Sing I-dum, sing I-day
   <br/>
   Johnny bought the youngest a gay-gold ring
   <br/>
   The boys are born for me
   <br/>
   Johnny bought the youngest a gay-gold ring
   <br/>
   He never bought the eldest a single thing
   <br/>
   I'll be true unto my love if he'll be true to me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Johnny bought the youngest a beaver hat
   <br/>
   Sing I-dum, sing I-day
   <br/>
   Johnny bought the youngest a beaver hat
   <br/>
   The boys are born for me
   <br/>
   Johnny bought the youngest a beaver hat
   <br/>
   The eldest didn't think much of that
   <br/>
   I'll be true unto my love if he'll be true to me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   As they were a-walking by the foamy brim
   <br/>
   Sing I-dum, sing I-day
   <br/>
   As they were a-walking by the foamy brim
   <br/>
   The boys are born for me
   <br/>
   As they were a-walking by the foamy brim
   <br/>
   The eldest pushed the youngest in
   <br/>
   I'll be true unto my love if he'll be true to me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Sister, oh sister, give me thy hand
   <br/>
   Sing I-dum, sing I-day
   <br/>
   Sister, oh sister, give me thy hand
   <br/>
   The boys are born for me
   <br/>
   Sister, oh sister, give me thy hand
   <br/>
   And you can have Johnny and all his land
   <br/>
   I'll be true unto my love if he'll be true to me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh sister, I'll not give you my hand
   <br/>
   Sing I-dum, sing I-day
   <br/>
   Oh sister, I'll not give you my hand
   <br/>
   The boys are born for me
   <br/>
   Oh sister, I'll not give you my hand
   <br/>
   And I'll have Johnny and all his land
   <br/>
   I'll be true unto my love if he'll be true to me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So away she sank and away she swam
   <br/>
   Sing I-dum, sing I-day
   <br/>
   So away she sank and away she swam
   <br/>
   The boys are born for me
   <br/>
   So away she sank and away she swam
   <br/>
   Until she came to the miller's dam
   <br/>
   I'll be true unto my love if he'll be true to me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The miller, he took her gay-gold ring
   <br/>
   Sing I-dum, sing I-day
   <br/>
   The miller, he took her gay-gold ring
   <br/>
   The boys are born for me
   <br/>
   The miller, he took her gay-gold ring
   <br/>
   And then he pushed her in again
   <br/>
   I'll be true unto my love if he'll be true to me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The miller, he was hanged on the mountain head
   <br/>
   Sing I-dum, sing I-day
   <br/>
   The miller, he was hanged on the mountain head
   <br/>
   The boys are born for me
   <br/>
   The miller, he was hanged on the mountain head
   <br/>
   The eldest sister was boiled in lead
   <br/>
   I'll be true unto my love if he'll be true to me
  </p>
