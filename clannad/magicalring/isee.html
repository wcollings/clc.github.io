  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Back in my schooldays, acting the fool days
   <br/>
   One and one and one is three
   <br/>
   And the man said, "Hey, come and cut yourself a piece of the big time"
   <br/>
   Armor-clad forces, riding Trojan horses
   <br/>
   Never made sense to me
   <br/>
   I didn't want to be a part of the great debate on moonshine
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   "Stop, pay the price," they said to me
   <br/>
   "Take this advice, you're out of your head"
   <br/>
   I said, "Stop, hold the phone
   <br/>
   This has to be cut to the bone
   <br/>
   Too bad, I see red, I see red, I see red"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Sly man stumbles, twists and he tumbles
   <br/>
   He always lands on his feet
   <br/>
   And he sets his face towards the far horizon
   <br/>
   Won't you come this way? Can't you go that way?
   <br/>
   But his rhythm don't miss a beat
   <br/>
   'Cause he's doing everything he can to keep surviving
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Stop, pay the price," they said to me
   <br/>
   "Take this advice, you're out of your head"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So who wants a riot? People should be quiet
   <br/>
   Don't we give them good TV?
   <br/>
   You can learn to love your lifetime of distraction
   <br/>
   Nothing on the inside, nothing on the outside
   <br/>
   All the way from A to Z
   <br/>
   I can live without that kind of satisfaction
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus 4x)
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
 </body>
