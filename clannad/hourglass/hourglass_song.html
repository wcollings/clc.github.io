  <p align="center">
   He comes out of silence and opens the door
   <br/>
   Waiting for someone to die
   <br/>
   Deep in her heart she is hoping for
   <br/>
   The long-lost one
   <br/>
   How could she know when the promise was made?
   <br/>
   So how can it end in this way?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Then four gray walls come tumbling down
   <br/>
   And just because her skin was brown
   <br/>
   No wonder she has grown so fast
   <br/>
   Those four gray walls were meant to last
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The friends there that she can count upon
   <br/>
   Take orders, but always the spirit holds
   <br/>
   Scenes of the never-ending trend
   <br/>
   She waits for the hours and hours to pass
   <br/>
   She looks to the hourglass
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Then four gray walls come tumbling down
   <br/>
   And just because her skin was brown
   <br/>
   No wonder she has grown so fast
   <br/>
   Those four gray walls were meant to last
   <br/>
   Those four gray walls were meant to last
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   As the shadows come down
   <br/>
   She sees him leaving
   <br/>
   She can recall
   <br/>
   Seems that this fire has lost its form
   <br/>
   The form of the hourglass
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The four gray walls came tumbling down
   <br/>
   And just because her skin was brown
   <br/>
   No wonder she has grown so fast
   <br/>
   Those four gray walls were meant to last
   <br/>
   Those four gray walls were meant to last
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Those four gray walls
   <br/>
   Four gray walls
  </p>
