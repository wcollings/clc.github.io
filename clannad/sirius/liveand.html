  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Can't you feel the change in a different way
   <br/>
   When you listen?
   <br/>
   Like standing in the cold on a rainy day
   <br/>
   It didn't really matter
   <br/>
   Had no choice, you had it your own way
   <br/>
   You live and learn
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It was just a shame on another day
   <br/>
   You know we kept on missing
   <br/>
   So try and try again, no, it's not in vain
   <br/>
   You live and you learn
   <br/>
   Heard that voice, oh do it your own way
   <br/>
   You live and learn
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It's what you have to say, you just say anyway
   <br/>
   Only space that matters
   <br/>
   Taking in the rays, holding out the pain
   <br/>
   So you live and you learn
   <br/>
   Take that choice to have it your own way
   <br/>
   So you live and learn
  </p>
