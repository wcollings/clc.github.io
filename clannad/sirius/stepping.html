   Moving driftwood
   <br/>
   Stopped and stared
   <br/>
   Proved too much for me
   <br/>
   I'm looking at an empty shell
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The young girl waiting
   <br/>
   She's waiting there
   <br/>
   With a suitcase in her hand
   <br/>
   She won't look back on the land
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But with a change of heart
   <br/>
   For you, it might come true
   <br/>
   It's like a stepping stone
   <br/>
   You know it's up to you
   <br/>
   Just like a stepping stone
   <br/>
   You know it might come true
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It's like a stepping stone
   <br/>
   You know it's up to you
   <br/>
   Just like a stepping stone
   <br/>
   You know it might come true
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Wants her freedom
   <br/>
   To see with her own eyes
   <br/>
   All the cities of the world
   <br/>
   And the faces strange to hers
   <br/>
   Strange in her eyes
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But with a change of heart
   <br/>
   For you, it might come true
   <br/>
   It's like a stepping stone
   <br/>
   You know it's up to you
   <br/>
   But with a change of heart
   <br/>
   You have to see it through
   <br/>
   It's like a stepping stone
   <br/>
   You know it's up to you
   <br/>
   Just like a stepping stone
   <br/>
   You know it might come true
  </p>
