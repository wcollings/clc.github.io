  <p align="center">
   Everybody's rushing around
   <br/>
   Trying to keep a hold on some peace of mind
   <br/>
   All the time
   <br/>
   And somebody's looking around
   <br/>
   Trying to find something to believe in
   <br/>
   To believe in
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   All the things they promised
   <br/>
   They're always lies
   <br/>
   Well, it's something
   <br/>
   Oh it's something to believe in
   <br/>
   You know it's something
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Every little once in a while
   <br/>
   You take a chance to win on a turning card
   <br/>
   But it may be hard
   <br/>
   We could be fooled on the merry-go-round
   <br/>
   But I'm trying to find something to believe in
   <br/>
   To believe in
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   All the things they promised
   <br/>
   You know they always lied
   <br/>
   It's something
   <br/>
   Something to believe in
   <br/>
   You know it's something
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I've been willing and strong all along
   <br/>
   Through chilling times in a sea of heartbreak
   <br/>
   Where you give and take
   <br/>
   I won't give in to the promises
   <br/>
   Until I find something to believe in
   <br/>
   To believe in
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh it's something
   <br/>
   That's something to believe in
   <br/>
   We've got something to believe in
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
