  </p>
  <p align="center">
   As I went a-walking in the North Country
   <br/>
   Down by Kirby Steven's I happened for to be
   <br/>
   As I was a-walking up and down the street
   <br/>
   A pretty little buy-a-broom I chanced for to meet
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus (after each verse)
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   For she was right, I was tight, everybody has their way
   <br/>
   It was the lish young buy-a-broom that led me astray
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She kindly then invited me to go a little way
   <br/>
   "Yes," was the answer to her I did say
   <br/>
   There was me with me music walkin' down the street
   <br/>
   And her with her tambourine was beatin' hand and feet
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Straight way out for Kendal town we steered, her and I
   <br/>
   Over young green mountains, the weather being dry
   <br/>
   We each had a bottle filled up to the top
   <br/>
   And whenever we were getting dry we took a little drop
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The night was coming on and good lodgings we did find
   <br/>
   Eatables of all kind and plenty of good wine
   <br/>
   Good bed and blankets just for we two
   <br/>
   And I rolled her in me arms, me boys, and wouldn't you do too?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Early the next morning we arose to go our way
   <br/>
   I called unto landlord to see what was to pay
   <br/>
   Fourteen and sixpence just for you two
   <br/>
   Four crowns upon the table my darling then she threw
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well the reason that we parted I now shall let you hear
   <br/>
   She started off for Germany right early the next year
   <br/>
   But me being unwilling for to cross the raging sea
   <br/>
   Here's a health unto my bonny lass wherever she may be
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
