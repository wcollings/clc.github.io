  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You men of wealth and luxury in country, town or shire
   <br/>
   You seldom give a thought to us while you're sittin' by your fire
   <br/>
   Or think upon the dangers that do threaten each poor soul
   <br/>
   As fearlessly they go to work to hue and dig the coal
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And it's down among the coal, me lads, and it's down among the coal
   <br/>
   All alone in the dark, I tell you, it's no lark
   <br/>
   It's down among the coal, me lads, and it's down among the coal
   <br/>
   And it's hard, hard work, and it's hard, hard work
   <br/>
   The life of a, the life of a miner
   <br/>
   The life of a miner underground
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Down shafts ill-ventilated, the miner, he must go
   <br/>
   And crawl upon his hands and knees where'er the roof is low
   <br/>
   The huer, putter, driver and the trapper in his hole
   <br/>
   They're all exposed to danger while they're down among the coal
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   And it's down among the coal, me lads, it's down among the coal
   <br/>
   All alone in the dark, I tell you, it's no lark
   <br/>
   It's down among the coal, me lads, down among the coal
   <br/>
   And it's hard, hard work, the life of a miner underground
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Down in the dark and dreary mine begrimed with dust and sweat
   <br/>
   While thinking of sweethearts and wives and some dear household pet
   <br/>
   "The pit's on fire," that dreadful word sends terror to each soul
   <br/>
   Overcome by gas, the miner meets his death among the coal
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So just bestow a thought to us that labor down below
   <br/>
   That work so hard by day and night to make your fireside glow
   <br/>
   There is no harder-working man if you search from pole to pole
   <br/>
   Than the honest-hearted miner who will hue and dig
   <br/>
   And work the life of a miner underground
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I tell you, it's hard, hard work
   <br/>
   The life of a miner underground
   <br/>
   (3x)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   From __
   <br/>
   __ later time is found
   <br/>
   I tell you, our children go neglected
   <br/>
   While we're working underground
   <br/>
   (2x)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   While we're working
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Down among the coal, me lads, it's down among the coal
   <br/>
   All alone in the dark, I tell you, it's no lark
   <br/>
   It's down among the coal, me lads, down among the coal
   <br/>
   And it's hard, hard work, the life of a miner
   <br/>
   And it's hard, hard work, the life of a miner underground
  </p>
