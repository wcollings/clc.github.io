  <p align="center">
   I see a strange man
   <br/>
   Running silently
   <br/>
   He never looks behind him
   <br/>
   He has no time to see
   <br/>
   He makes no sound, he has no voice
   <br/>
   The ground he doesn't feel
   <br/>
   But he's always on the run
   <br/>
   And I wonder if he's real
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Chorus:
   <br/>
   Run on, run on, shadow of time
   <br/>
   Run on, run on, shadow of time
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   His first name is today
   <br/>
   His last name is tomorrow
   <br/>
   He knows no pain, he knows no joy
   <br/>
   Doesn't think of sorrow
   <br/>
   Fast and small, he's slow and tall
   <br/>
   Never stops to rest
   <br/>
   But I know where he's goin'
   <br/>
   'Cause I know him the best
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus 2x)
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
