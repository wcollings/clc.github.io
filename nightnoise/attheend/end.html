  </p>
  <p align="center">
   At the end of the evening as the sun is going down
   <br/>
   And all the wee songbirds are making their last sounds
   <br/>
   It's then I'm thinking of you, I close my eyes and see
   <br/>
   I long for the moment when you'll return, a chroí
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We'll go and watch the water and bathe in its bright charms
   <br/>
   As the shiny waves of blue and silver roll, I run into your arms
   <br/>
   We'll talk all that small-town talk and secrets of the heart
   <br/>
   With the twilight all the colors fade, and we melt into the dark
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I'm thinking of you, darlin', in the mornin', noon and night
   <br/>
   But especially in the evening when nature seems so bright
   <br/>
   Yes, it's then I'm thinking of you in the quiet of my heart
   <br/>
   I hold you there a moment as though we'd never part
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
