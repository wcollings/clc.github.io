  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The pale moon was rising above the green mountain
   <br/>
   The sun was declining beneath the blue sea
   <br/>
   When I strayed with my love to the pure crystal fountain
   <br/>
   That stands in the beautiful vale of Tralee
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She was lovely and fair as the rose of the summer
   <br/>
   Yet 'twas not her beauty alone that won me
   <br/>
   Oh no, 'twas the truth in her eyes ever dawning
   <br/>
   That made me love Mary, the rose of Tralee
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The cool shades of evening their mantle were spreading
   <br/>
   And Mary, all smiling, was listening to me
   <br/>
   The moon through the valley her pale rays was shedding
   <br/>
   When I won the heart of the rose of Tralee
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
