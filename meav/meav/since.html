  <p align="center">
   We might as well lie down, love
   <br/>
   Lie down and close our eyes
   <br/>
   We might as well go walking
   <br/>
   In the country of the blind
   <br/>
   The long grass is grown
   <br/>
   And all the birds flown
   <br/>
   To their homes away in the blue
   <br/>
   And nothing's left the same
   <br/>
   The whole world is changed
   <br/>
   Since you and I were true
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And how can a story be ended
   <br/>
   When it didn't hardly begin?
   <br/>
   How can my glass be so empty
   <br/>
   When it's filled up to the brim?
   <br/>
   And it wasn't always so
   <br/>
   It didn't always go
   <br/>
   We had something better to do
   <br/>
   And it didn't always rain
   <br/>
   Every single day
   <br/>
   When you and I were true
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   In a country where we are headed, love
   <br/>
   There is nothing but rocks and stones
   <br/>
   No friendly plant or animal
   <br/>
   No angel to guide you home
   <br/>
   Until some day you'll find
   <br/>
   In the country of the blind
   <br/>
   Some wonder just like you
   <br/>
   And the singing of a bird
   <br/>
   That nobody has heard
   <br/>
   Since you and I were true
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We might as well lie down, love
   <br/>
   Lie down and close our eyes
   <br/>
   We might as well go walking
   <br/>
   In the country of the blind
   <br/>
   The long grass is grown
   <br/>
   And all the birds flown
   <br/>
   To their homes away in the blue
   <br/>
   And nothing's left the same
   <br/>
   The whole world is changed
   <br/>
   Since you and I were true
  </p>
