  <p align="center">
   Queen Jane lay in labor full nine days or more
   <br/>
   'Til her women were so tired, they could no longer there
   <br/>
   They could no longer there
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Good women, good women, good women as ye be
   <br/>
   Will you open my right side and find my baby
   <br/>
   And find my baby?"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Oh no," cried the women, "That's a thing never can be
   <br/>
   We will send for King Henry and hear what he may say
   <br/>
   And hear what he may say"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   King Henry was sent for, King Henry did come
   <br/>
   Saying, "What do ail you, my lady? Your eyes, they look so dim
   <br/>
   Your eyes, they look so dim"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "King Henry, King Henry, will you do one thing for me?
   <br/>
   That's to open my right side and find my baby
   <br/>
   And find my baby"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Oh no," cried King Henry, "That's a thing I'll never do
   <br/>
   If I lose the flower of England, I shall lose the branch too
   <br/>
   I shall lose the branch too"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There was fiddling, aye, and dancing on the day the babe was born
   <br/>
   But poor Queen Jane beloved lay cold as the stone
   <br/>
   Lay cold as the stone
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Adew adew, my heart is lost
   <br/>
   Adew, my joy and my solace
   <br/>
   With double sorrow, complain I must
   <br/>
   Until I die, alas, alas
   <br/>
   Until I die, alas, alas
   <br/>
   (2x)
  </p>
