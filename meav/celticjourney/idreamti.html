  <p align="center">
   I dreamt I dwelt in marble halls
   <br/>
   With vassals and serfs at my side
   <br/>
   And of all who assembled within those walls
   <br/>
   That I was the hope and the pride
   <br/>
   I had riches all to great to count
   <br/>
   And a high ancestral name
   <br/>
   But I also dreamt, which pleased me most
   <br/>
   That you loved me still the same
   <br/>
   That you loved me, you loved me still the same
   <br/>
   That you loved me, you loved me still the same
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I dreamt that suitors sought my hand
   <br/>
   That knights upon bended knee
   <br/>
   With words no maiden's heart could withstand
   <br/>
   They pledged their faith to me
   <br/>
   And I dreamt that one of that noble host
   <br/>
   Came forth my hand to claim
   <br/>
   But I also dreamt, which charmed me most
   <br/>
   That you loved me still the same
   <br/>
   That you loved me, you loved me still the same
   <br/>
   That you loved me, you loved me still the same
  </p>
