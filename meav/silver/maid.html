  <p align="center">
   Abroad as I was walking one evening in the spring
   <br/>
   I heard a maid in Bedlam who mournfully did sing
   <br/>
   Her chains she rattled on her hands, and thus replied she
   <br/>
   "I love my love because I know my love loves me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh cruel were his parents who sent my love to sea
   <br/>
   And cruel was the sailing ship that bore my love from me
   <br/>
   Yet I love his parents since their his, although they've ruined me
   <br/>
   I love my love because I know my love loves me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   With straw I'll weave a garland, I'll weave it wondrous fine
   <br/>
   With roses, lilies, daisies I'll mix the eglantine
   <br/>
   And I'll present it to my love when he returns from sea
   <br/>
   I love my love because I know my love loves me"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Just as she sat there weeping, her love, he came on land
   <br/>
   Then hearing she was in Bedlam he ran straight out of hand
   <br/>
   He flew into her snow-white arms, and thus replied he
   <br/>
   "I love my love because I know my love loves me"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She said, "My love, don't frighten me, are you my love or no?"
   <br/>
   "Oh yes, my dearest Nancy, I am your love also
   <br/>
   I am returned to make amends for all your injury
   <br/>
   I love my love because I know my love loves me
   <br/>
   I love my love because I know my love loves me""
  </p>
