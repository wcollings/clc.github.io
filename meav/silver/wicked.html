     Lyrics

  </p>
  <p align="center">
   A mother lived by the North Sea shore
   <br/>
   Daughters were the babes she bore
   <br/>
   One grew radiant as the sun
   <br/>
   Darkly grew the elder one
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   A knight came riding to their door
   <br/>
   He travelled far to be their wooer
   <br/>
   He courted both with gold and rings
   <br/>
   But loved the younger o'er all things
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Sister, won't you walk with me
   <br/>
   To watch the ships sail o'er the sea?"
   <br/>
   As they walked the rocky shore
   <br/>
   The dark one pushed her sister o'er
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Sister, sister, let me live
   <br/>
   All that's mine I'll surely give"
   <br/>
   "Thy bridegroom I will take and more
   <br/>
   But thou shalt never come ashore"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Off she floated like a swan
   <br/>
   The salt sea bore her body on
   <br/>
   You could not see her lily feet
   <br/>
   Her golden fringes were so deep
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   A minstrel walking by the strand
   <br/>
   Saw her body float to land
   <br/>
   When he looked that lady on
   <br/>
   He sighed and made a heavy moan
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He made a harp of her breastbone
   <br/>
   Whose sound would melt a heart of stone
   <br/>
   Took the strands of her bright hair
   <br/>
   And with them strung his harp so rare
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He brought the harp to the wedding hall
   <br/>
   There to play before them all
   <br/>
   When they set it on a stone
   <br/>
   The harp began to play alone
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The strings sang out a dreadful sound
   <br/>
   "The bride her younger sister drowned
   <br/>
   Now her secret you all know
   <br/>
   Her guilty tears will surely flow"
  </p>
