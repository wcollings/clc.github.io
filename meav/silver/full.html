  <p align="center">
   Full fathom five thy father lies
   <br/>
   Of his bones are coral made
   <br/>
   Those are pearls that were his eyes
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Full fathom five thy father lies
   <br/>
   Of his bones are coral made
   <br/>
   Those are pearls that were his eyes
   <br/>
   Nothing of him that doth fade
   <br/>
   But doth suffer a sea-change
   <br/>
   Into something rich and strange, rich and strange
   <br/>
   Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell
   <br/>
   Hark, now I hear them, ding-dong, bell
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Ding-dong, bell...
  </p>
