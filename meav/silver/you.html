  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You brought me up and out of the water
   <br/>
   You brought me up to forget
   <br/>
   I had ever been, I could ever breathe
   <br/>
   In the water under your heart
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I darkened your door and your days, you said
   <br/>
   You couldn't sleep the night
   <br/>
   With the sound of the sea hard on my heels
   <br/>
   Climbing the stairs to your bed
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You promised me gloves from the skins of the fishes
   <br/>
   The smile of a dolphin for a ring in my hands
   <br/>
   You left me with nothing but a mouthful of air
   <br/>
   And promises wide as the ocean
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You left me down for once and for all
   <br/>
   You left me out in the open
   <br/>
   Under mackerel skies, high and dry
   <br/>
   Way out of the reach of our sea
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Way out of reach and out of my depth
   <br/>
   I wear your love like a skin
   <br/>
   That hurts when anyone touches me
   <br/>
   Where you left me down for once and for all
   <br/>
   Out of the reach of our sea
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You promised me gloves from the skins of the fishes
   <br/>
   The smile of a dolphin for a ring in my hands
   <br/>
   But you left me with nothing but a mouthful of air
   <br/>
   And promises wide as the ocean
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You brought me up and out of the water
   <br/>
   You brought me up to forget
   <br/>
   I had ever been, I could ever breathe
   <br/>
   In the water under your heart
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
 </body>
