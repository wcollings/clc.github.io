  <p align="center">
   When first I went a sea-apprentice bound
   <br/>
   I sailed the salt seas all 'round and 'round
   <br/>
   I scarce had sailed a voyage but one
   <br/>
   When I fell in love with my charming Anne
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I went to my captain both stout and bold
   <br/>
   And unto him my secret told
   <br/>
   I love yon lass as I love my life
   <br/>
   What would I give if she were my wife?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, the captain said, "You're a foolish boy
   <br/>
   For to court a girl that you'll ne'er enjoy
   <br/>
   For she'll have lovers while you're at sea
   <br/>
   And she'll be married e're you'll be free"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, I don't know but I'll go and try
   <br/>
   For she might fancy an apprentice boy
   <br/>
   And she might alter her mind for me
   <br/>
   And wait on me until I be free
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, I bought her ribbons, I bought her gloves
   <br/>
   These things to prove of a heart that loves
   <br/>
   She accepted all and she was not shy
   <br/>
   And she vowed to wait for her apprentice boy
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When my ship is anchored and my work is over
   <br/>
   I'll steer my barque for sweet Erin's shore
   <br/>
   In my native country, my love I'll enjoy
   <br/>
   And she'll welcome home her apprentice boy
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So come all you sea-apprentices where e'er you be
   <br/>
   Never slight your true love while you're at sea
   <br/>
   Just love her as you love your life
   <br/>
   And she'll consent to become your wife
  </p>
