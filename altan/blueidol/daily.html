  <p align="center">
   The trees, they grow high, and the leaves, they do grow green
   <br/>
   Many is the time my true love I've seen
   <br/>
   Many an hour I watched him all alone
   <br/>
   He's young but he's daily growing
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Father, dear father, you've done me great wrong
   <br/>
   You have married me to a boy who is too young
   <br/>
   I am twice twelve and he is but fourteen
   <br/>
   He's young but he's daily growing
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Daughter, dear daughter, I've done you no wrong
   <br/>
   I have married you to a great lord's son
   <br/>
   And he will be a man for you when I am dead and gone
   <br/>
   He's young but he's daily growing
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Father, dear father, if you see fit
   <br/>
   We'll send him to college for another year yet
   <br/>
   I'll tie a blue ribbon all around his head
   <br/>
   To let the maidens know that he is married
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   One day I was looking over my father's castle wall
   <br/>
   I spied all the boys playing with a ball
   <br/>
   And my own true love, he was the flower of them all
   <br/>
   He's young but he's daily growing
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And so early in the morning at the dawning of the day
   <br/>
   They went into a hayfield for to have some sport and play
   <br/>
   And what they did there she never would declare
   <br/>
   But she never more complained of his growing
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   At the age of fourteen he was a married man
   <br/>
   At the age of fifteen, the father of my son
   <br/>
   At the age of sixteen, his grave, it was green
   <br/>
   And death had put an end to his growing
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I'll buy my love some flannel, I'll make my love a shroud
   <br/>
   And every stitch I put in it, the tears, they'll pour down
   <br/>
   Amd every stitch I put in it, how the tears, they will flow
   <br/>
   Cruel fate has put an end to his growing
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
