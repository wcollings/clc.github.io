  <p align="center">
   Being on the twenty-third of June
   <br/>
   Oh as I sat weaving all at my loom
   <br/>
   Being on the twenty-third of June
   <br/>
   Oh as I sat weaving all at my loom
   <br/>
   I heard a thrush singing on yon bush
   <br/>
   And the song she sang was the jug of punch
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   What more pleasure can a boy desire
   <br/>
   Than sitting down, oh beside the fire
   <br/>
   What more pleasure can a boy desire
   <br/>
   Than sitting down, oh beside the fire
   <br/>
   And in his hand, oh a jug of punch
   <br/>
   And on his knee a tidy wench
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When I am dead and left in my mold
   <br/>
   At my head and feet place a flowing bowl
   <br/>
   When I am dead and left in my mold
   <br/>
   At my head and feet place a flowing bowl
   <br/>
   And every young man that passes by
   <br/>
   He can have a drink and remember I
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Being on the twenty-third of June
   <br/>
   Oh as I sat weaving all at my loom
   <br/>
   Being on the twenty-third of June
   <br/>
   Oh as I sat weaving all at my loom
   <br/>
   I heard a thrush singing on yon bush
   <br/>
   And the song she sang was the jug of punch
  </p>
