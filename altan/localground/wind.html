  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There were two sisters of County Clare
   <br/>
   Oh the wind and rain
   <br/>
   One was dark and the other was fair
   <br/>
   Oh the dreadful wind and rain
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And they both had the love of the miller's son
   <br/>
   Oh the wind and rain
   <br/>
   But he was fond of the fairer one
   <br/>
   Oh the dreadful wind and rain
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So she pushed her into the river to drown
   <br/>
   Oh the wind and rain
   <br/>
   And watched her as she floated out
   <br/>
   Oh the dreadful wind and rain
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She floated 'til she came to the miller's pond
   <br/>
   Oh the wind and rain
   <br/>
   Dead on the water like a golden swan
   <br/>
   Oh the dreadful wind and rain
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And she came to rest on the riverside
   <br/>
   Oh the wind and rain
   <br/>
   And her bones were washed by the rolling tide
   <br/>
   Oh the dreadful wind and rain
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And along the road came a fiddler fair
   <br/>
   Oh the wind and rain
   <br/>
   And found her bones just lying there
   <br/>
   Oh the dreadful wind and rain
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So he made a fiddle peg of her long finger bone
   <br/>
   Oh the wind and rain
   <br/>
   He made a fiddle peg of her long finger bone
   <br/>
   Crying oh the dreadful wind and rain
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And he strung his fiddle bow with her long yellow hair
   <br/>
   Oh the wind and rain
   <br/>
   He strung his fiddle bow with her long yellow hair
   <br/>
   Crying oh the dreadful wind and rain
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And he made a little fiddle of her little breast bone
   <br/>
   Oh the wind and rain
   <br/>
   He made a fiddle of her little breast bone
   <br/>
   Crying oh the dreadful wind and rain
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But the only tune that the fiddle would play
   <br/>
   Was oh the wind and rain
   <br/>
   The only tune that the fiddle would play
   <br/>
   Was oh the dreadful wind and rain
  </p>

  </cleaned>
