  <p align="center">
   Oh as I roved out one bright summer's morn
   <br/>
   Down by Blackwaterside
   <br/>
   I'd be gazing on the flowers that did bloom all around
   <br/>
   When a pretty Irish girl I spied
   <br/>
   Oh 'twas red and rosy was her cheeks
   <br/>
   Golden yellow was her hair
   <br/>
   As I clasped her by the lily-white hand
   <br/>
   And I said, "My young sweetheart fair"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There be many a good man's daughter
   <br/>
   Going around from town to town
   <br/>
   There be many a good man's daughter with
   <br/>
   Her hair all hanging down
   <br/>
   They'll be rocking the cradles the whole day long
   <br/>
   Singing, "Low-la, low-la, low"
   <br/>
   Was there ever a poor misfortunate girl
   <br/>
   Was as easily led as you?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh that wasn't the promise that you made to me
   <br/>
   Down by Blackwaterside
   <br/>
   That wasn't the promise that you made to me
   <br/>
   When you asked me to be your bride
   <br/>
   That wasn't the promise that you made to me
   <br/>
   When you swore you'd be loyal and true
   <br/>
   When the fishes fly and the seas run dry
   <br/>
   I'll return and I'll marry you
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
