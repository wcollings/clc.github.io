  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Lately last night, I was asked to a wedding
   <br/>
   The wedding of a fair maid who proved to me unkind
   <br/>
   For that day as she thought of her intended young lover
   <br/>
   Thoughts of her old one had run through her mind
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Supper being over and all things were ended
   <br/>
   Every young man was to sing a fine song
   <br/>
   Until it came to the turn of her own foreign lover
   <br/>
   And the song that he sang to the bride did belong
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   How can you sit at another man's table?
   <br/>
   How can you drink of another man's wine?
   <br/>
   How can you lie in the arms of another?
   <br/>
   Many's the night, love, that you lay in mine
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Many's the one has been seven years parted
   <br/>
   Seven years parted and did return again
   <br/>
   But I have only been two years away, love
   <br/>
   Two years away, love, and did return again
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The bride, she was seated at the head of the table
   <br/>
   Very well she knew to whom the song did belong
   <br/>
   Her heart, it grew faint, she could stand it no longer
   <br/>
   Down at the feet of the bridegroom she fell
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Sobbing and sighing she rose from the table
   <br/>
   Sobbing and sighing she went to her bed
   <br/>
   Early next morning the bridegroom awakened
   <br/>
   He turned to embrace her and found she was dead
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Saying, "Annie, dear Annie, I knew you never loved me
   <br/>
   My love and your love could never agree
   <br/>
   For I knew all along that your poor heart was breaking
   <br/>
   All for the sake of a foreign young man"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So now I must wear a frock of deep mourning
   <br/>
   A frock of deep mourning, one, two and three
   <br/>
   I must wear to her wake my own wedding garment
   <br/>
   Ne'er again shall I go between the bark and the tree
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
