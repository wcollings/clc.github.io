  <p align="center">
   One morning in springtime as day was a-dawning
   <br/>
   Bright Phoebus had risen from over the lea
   <br/>
   I spied a fair maiden as homeward she wandered
   <br/>
   From herding her flocks on the hills of Glenshee
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I stood in amazement, says I, "Pretty fair maid
   <br/>
   If you will come down to St. John's Town with me
   <br/>
   There's ne'er been a lady set foot in my castle
   <br/>
   There's ne'er been a lady dressed grander than thee"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   A coach and six horses to go at your bidding
   <br/>
   And all men that speak shall say "ma'am unto thee
   <br/>
   Fine servants to serve you and go at your bidding
   <br/>
   I'll make you my bride, my sweet lass of Glenshee
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Oh what do I care for your castles and coaches?
   <br/>
   And what do I care for your gay grandeury?
   <br/>
   I'd rather be home at my cot, at my spinning
   <br/>
   Or herding my flocks on the hills of Glenshee"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Away with such nonsense and get up beside me
   <br/>
   E'er summer comes on my sweet bride you will be
   <br/>
   And then in my arms I will gently caress thee"
   <br/>
   'Twas then she consented, I took her with me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Seven years have rolled on since we were united
   <br/>
   There's many's a change, but there's no change on me
   <br/>
   And my love, she's as fair as that morn on the mountain
   <br/>
   When I plucked me a wild rose on the hills of Glenshee
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
 </body>
