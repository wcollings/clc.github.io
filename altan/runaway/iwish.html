  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I wish my love was a red, red rose growing in yon garden fair
   <br/>
   And I to be the gardener, of her I would take care
   <br/>
   There's not a month throughout the year, that my love I'd renew
   <br/>
   I'd garnish her with flowers fine, sweet William, Thyme and Rue
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I wish I was a butterfly, I'd light on my love's breast
   <br/>
   And if I was a blue cuckoo, I'd sing my love to rest
   <br/>
   And if I was a nightingale, I'd sing the daylight clear
   <br/>
   I'd sit and sing for you, Molly, for once I loved you dear
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I wish I was in Dublin town and seated on the grass
   <br/>
   In my right hand, a jug of punch, and on my knee, a lass
   <br/>
   I'd call for liquor freely and I'd pay before I'd go
   <br/>
   I'd roll my Molly in my arms, let the wind blow high or low
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
