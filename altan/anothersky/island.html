  </p>
  <p align="center">
   With a wave of her hand and her sparkling eye
   <br/>
   My island girl bid me good-bye
   <br/>
   For another dream in another time
   <br/>
   For another life under another sky
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But don't just cut off your heart, keep it open and sure
   <br/>
   Keep it free from hurt and keep an open door
   <br/>
   And let the spirit of love that united our soul
   <br/>
   Be a gentle dove and guide you to your goal
   <br/>
   And I'll go to that stream and I'll sing my own prayer
   <br/>
   That my island girl shall be safe everywhere
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Sing away while you can and before very long
   <br/>
   The coming tide brings the chosen one
   <br/>
   And there is a hope and there is a peace
   <br/>
   In that ancient land where my angel sleeps
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And when your river runs high, let it flow, let it flow
   <br/>
   It's your time with life to let your garden grow
   <br/>
   And when your burden gets rough, let it go, let it go
   <br/>
   Let your strength return on every breeze that blows
   <br/>
   Through that ancient land, through eternity
   <br/>
   Oh my island girl, remember me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   For your life has its course and you never can say
   <br/>
   Who you'll meet and marry along your way
   <br/>
   But be sure from the start that the cities behind
   <br/>
   Love the land's living heart and breath eternal time
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And when your river runs dry and your halo is torn
   <br/>
   Drink the living stream in the calm of the dawn
   <br/>
   And may you travel in peace and may your children be blessed
   <br/>
   And your mind released and your soul caressed
   <br/>
   In that faraway land where my spirit flies
   <br/>
   To my island girl under those ancient skies
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And with a wave of her hand and her sparkling eye
   <br/>
   My island girl bid me good-bye
   <br/>
   For another dream in another time
   <br/>
   For another life under another sky
  </p>
