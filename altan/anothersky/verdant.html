  <p align="center">
   As I roved out one evening fair
   <br/>
   By the verdant braes of Screen
   <br/>
   I set my back to a hawthorn tree
   <br/>
   To view the sun in the west country
   <br/>
   And the dew on the forest green
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   A lad I spied by Abhann's side
   <br/>
   And a maiden by his knee
   <br/>
   And he was as dark as the very brown wood
   <br/>
   And she all whey and wan to see
   <br/>
   All whey and wan was she
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Oh sit you down on the grass," he said
   <br/>
   "On the dewy grass so green
   <br/>
   For the wee birds all have come and gone
   <br/>
   Since I my true love have seen," he said
   <br/>
   "Since I my true love have seen"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Then I'll not sit on the grass," she said
   <br/>
   "Nor be a love of thine
   <br/>
   For I hear you love a Connaught maid
   <br/>
   And your heart's no longer mine," she said
   <br/>
   "And your heart's no longer mine"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "And I will climb a high, high tree
   <br/>
   And I'll rob a wild bird's nest
   <br/>
   And back I'll bring whatever I do find
   <br/>
   To the arms that I love best," she said
   <br/>
   "To the arms that I love best"
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
