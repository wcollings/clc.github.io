  <p align="center">
   One pleasant summer's morning when all the flowers were springing O
   <br/>
   Nature was adorning and the wee birds sweetly singing O
   <br/>
   I met my love near Banbridge Town, my charming blue-eyed Sally O
   <br/>
   She's the queen of the County Down, the flower of Magherally O
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   With admiration I did gaze upon this blue-eyed maiden O
   <br/>
   Adam wasn't half so much pleased when he met Eve in Eden O
   <br/>
   Her skin was like the lily white that grows in yonder valley O
   <br/>
   She's my queen and my heart's delight, the flower of Magherally O
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Her yellow hair in ringlets clung, her shoes were Spanish leather O
   <br/>
   Her bonnet with blue ribbons strung, her scarlet cap and feather O
   <br/>
   Like Venus bright she did appear, my charming blue-eyed Sally O
   <br/>
   She's the girl that I love dear, the flower of Magherally O
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I hope the day will surely come when we'll join hands together O
   <br/>
   'Tis then I'll bring my darling home in spite of wind or weather O
   <br/>
   And let them all say what they will and let them reel and rally O
   <br/>
   For I shall wed the girl I love, the flower of Magherally O
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
