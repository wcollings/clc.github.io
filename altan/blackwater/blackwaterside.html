  <p align="center">
   One evening fair to take the air
   <br/>
   Down by Blackwaterside
   <br/>
   'Twas a-gazing all around me
   <br/>
   That the Irish lad I spied
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   All through the far part of the night
   <br/>
   We did lie in sport and play
   <br/>
   When this young man arose and gathered his clothes
   <br/>
   Saying, "Fare thee well today"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   That's not the promise that you gave to me
   <br/>
   When you lay on my breast
   <br/>
   You could make me believe with your lying words
   <br/>
   That the sun rose in the west
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Go home, go home to your father's garden
   <br/>
   Go home and weep your fill
   <br/>
   And think on your own misfortune
   <br/>
   You brought on with your want and will
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   For there's not a girl in this whole wide world
   <br/>
   As easily led as I
   <br/>
   And when fishes can fly and the seas run dry
   <br/>
   It is then that you'll marry I
   <br/>
   It is then that you'll marry I
  </p>
