  <p align="center">
   I just got dressed, now I'm tight and trendy
   <br/>
   These brand new shoes don't know where they'll send me
   <br/>
   If I looked any better, I'd go out of my mind
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Get off the phone from some girl I've just met
   <br/>
   Check my reflection and light a cigarette
   <br/>
   If I looked any better, I'd go out of my mind
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And it's all the same
   <br/>
   In the Saturday rain
   <br/>
   Where I'm passing time
   <br/>
   'Til she is mine
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   When you're not sure what to say, just say hey
   <br/>
   And you're too aware to care, and it's so unfair
   <br/>
   And you don't know where to go, and your heart is low
   <br/>
   And you don't know what to see, just see me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Down in the city the posers have the fun
   <br/>
   Just as well that I'm not the only one
   <br/>
   If I looked any better, I'd go out of my mind
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Though I seem like a bad one now and then
   <br/>
   Guess I know that I won't be here again
   <br/>
   If I looked any better, I'd go out of my mind
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Now I'm walking beneath those city lights
   <br/>
   This crazy town is a young man's paradise
   <br/>
   If I looked any better, I'd go out of my mind
  </p>
