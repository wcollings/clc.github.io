  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And the city's strength
   <br/>
   Should've held a thousand years
   <br/>
   And we'd made our plans
   <br/>
   From the dreams you'd had between those years
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Don't try to tell me that what we had is magic
   <br/>
   And make me see the miracle of love
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When the city fell
   <br/>
   You must've wept a thousand tears
   <br/>
   But the walls we'd built
   <br/>
   Were still standing after all these years
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Distinct the fallen angel, ties your body to a rack
   <br/>
   And you feel her soul's condition as her hands caress your back
   <br/>
   But I will not believe in angels or in any devil's hell
   <br/>
   And I have no faith in heroes or in any lover's spells
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Don't try to tell me that what we had is magic
   <br/>
   I think it's just the color of your hair
   <br/>
   The dreams keep coming on and maybe they will linger
   <br/>
   Maybe they will linger
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Don't try to tell me that what we had is magic
   <br/>
   I think it's just the color of your hair
   <br/>
   The dreams keep on coming and maybe they will linger
   <br/>
   Maybe they will linger
  </p>
