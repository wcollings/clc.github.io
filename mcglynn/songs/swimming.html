  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I woke in my hat and my boots because I knew that I'd miss the show
   <br/>
   I didn't know what day it was and I didn't need to know
   <br/>
   The Irish summer is like no other for skipping down to the sea
   <br/>
   But a hot day down by the barrow so brown is like heaven on earth to me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So down we go in the summer's glow, you'll run to keep up with me
   <br/>
   We're set for the day and we know we can stay with a bun and a bottle of tea
   <br/>
   The Irish summer is like no other for skipping down to the sea
   <br/>
   But a hot day down by the barrow so brown is like heaven on earth to me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   So we run outside, say, "Who cares about the weather?"
   <br/>
   Tell me you'll be mine for a thousand years
   <br/>
   And the water's fine, wish this day could last forever
   <br/>
   And stay summertime for a thousand years
   <br/>
   Jump ya little boy, sink down into the barrow
   <br/>
   Jump ya little boy down deep into the barrow
   <br/>
   Swim ya little boy, now swimming in the barrow
   <br/>
   Swim ya little boy down deep into the barrow
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The girls arrive so very alive with ribbons and shiny hair
   <br/>
   You're risking your life with a class of a dive, I hope that I see you there
   <br/>
   The Irish summer is like no other for skipping down to the sea
   <br/>
   But a hot day down by the barrow so brown is like heaven on earth to me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I woke in my hat and my boots because I knew that I'd miss the show
   <br/>
   I didn't know what day it was and I didn't need to know
   <br/>
   The Irish summer is like no other for skipping down to the sea
   <br/>
   But a hot day down by the barrow so brown is like heaven on earth to me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Swim ya little boy down deep into the barrow
   <br/>
   Swim ya little boy down deep into the barrow
   <br/>
   Jump ya little boy, sink down into the barrow
  </p>
