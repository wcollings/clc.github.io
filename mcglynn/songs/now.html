   It was all right for a while
   <br/>
   We had time for a while
   <br/>
   And then you came and then we met
   <br/>
   And put the flowers in our hair
   <br/>
   It was all right...
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It was all right for a time
   <br/>
   We had fun for a time
   <br/>
   And then she came and then you left
   <br/>
   And took the flowers from our hair
   <br/>
   It was all right...
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Time knows we fade away
   <br/>
   I know we fade away
   <br/>
   You said you loved me
   <br/>
   Now and forever, now and forever, now and forever
   <br/>
   It was all right...
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It was all right when we made love
   <br/>
   It was fine when we made love
   <br/>
   And then she came and then you left
   <br/>
   And took the flowers from her hair
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It was all right for a time
   <br/>
   We had time for a time
   <br/>
   And then she came and then you left
   <br/>
   And put the flowers in her hair
   <br/>
   It was all right...
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You said you loved me, you said you loved me
   <br/>
   Now and forever...
