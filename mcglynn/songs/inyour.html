  <p align="center">
   Just call me, you'll find me
   <br/>
   By night and by day
   <br/>
   Your sweetness still haunts me
   <br/>
   And won't go away
   <br/>
   But I saw the disguise in your eyes
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   How can you embrace me
   <br/>
   And then let me go?
   <br/>
   Your sweet lips still chase me
   <br/>
   Wherever I go
   <br/>
   But I saw the disguise in your eyes
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I've searched through the wind and the rain
   <br/>
   Just to be where you are
   <br/>
   But you couldn't be further away
   <br/>
   If I'd reached for a star
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The devil that wooed me
   <br/>
   Was there from the start
   <br/>
   Your memory still wounds me
   <br/>
   So deep in my heart
   <br/>
   But I saw the disguise in your eyes
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I'd wanted the world
   <br/>
   When all that I needed was you
   <br/>
   And too late then I wished for you back
   <br/>
   But it didn't come true
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So call me, you'll find me
   <br/>
   By night and by day
   <br/>
   Your sweetness still haunts me
   <br/>
   And won't go away
   <br/>
   Then I saw the disguise in your eyes
   <br/>
   In your eyes, in your eyes
  </p>
