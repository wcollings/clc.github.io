  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She took my hand and she waits for the sinner
   <br/>
   Such a strange place that she waits for the sun to come
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She took my hand as we searched at the center
   <br/>
   And all that time we were searching, the sun was gone
   <br/>
   Was gone...
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   In this pale land I will search for you always
   <br/>
   I know that once I have found you the sun will come
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Throughout all time I will wait for you somewhere
   <br/>
   I know that long as I'm waiting the sun will come
   <br/>
   Will come...
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She took my hand and she waits for the sinner
   <br/>
   Such a strange place that she waits for the sun to come
   <br/>
   To come...
  </p>
