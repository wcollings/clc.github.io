  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The night wanders on
   <br/>
   And her ghost sings in a summer song
   <br/>
   Still she'll be away from me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You'll wake at her side
   <br/>
   As your world spins in a thunderstorm, but still
   <br/>
   The storm lingers on
   <br/>
   And you won't know where you're going to
   <br/>
   But still she'll go on
   <br/>
   Justified to find a place away from me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   And all through the night I'm dreaming of you
   <br/>
   And all through the night I do, yes, I do
   <br/>
   And all through the night I'm searching for you
   <br/>
   And all through the night
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You stay by her shore
   <br/>
   And you feel so indestructible, but still
   <br/>
   She wakes on her own
   <br/>
   As her sun sets in an hourglass
   <br/>
   But still she'll go on
   <br/>
   Justified to find a place away from me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Through the night, through the night
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And all through the night I'm searching for you
   <br/>
   And all through the night I'm searching for you
  </p>
