  </p>
  <p align="center">
   They met in rainy late December in the place they'd always met
   <br/>
   And she looked as bright as burning ember, but Tommy just looked wet
   <br/>
   And he didn't laugh at all, turn to face the empty wall again
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When she held him, love was in his eyes, but it never touched his brain
   <br/>
   And she couldn't play the way he could 'cause she didn't know the game
   <br/>
   And she didn't laugh at all, turn to face the empty wall again
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And the summer came again, then winter, and she didn't really care
   <br/>
   'Cause she hadn't seen his face forever, 'cause she knew he wasn't there
   <br/>
   And she didn't laugh at all, turn to face the empty wall again
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So she let them go their separate ways 'cause she knew she might as well
   <br/>
   And their story fades down all the days, now there's nothin' left to tell
   <br/>
   And she doesn't laugh at all, turn to face the empty wall again
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   They met in rainy late December in the place they'd always met
   <br/>
   And she looked as bright as burning ember, but Tommy just looked wet
   <br/>
   And he didn't laugh at all, turn to face the empty wall again
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And she didn't laugh at all, turn to face the empty wall again
  </p>
