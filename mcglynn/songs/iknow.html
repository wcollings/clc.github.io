  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She's the light brush of wings of a myriad thing
   <br/>
   In the place between summer and winter
   <br/>
   She's the last ray of light in the cold dark of night
   <br/>
   She's sudden and secret
   <br/>
   I know you hear me whenever you're near me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She's the first to be heard and the last dying word
   <br/>
   As the tear stains collect on your pillow
   <br/>
   She's the shape in the rain through a cold windowpane
   <br/>
   She suddenly sees you
   <br/>
   I know you hear me whenever you're near me
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
