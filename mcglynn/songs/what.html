  <p align="center">
   Memories like falling leaves
   <br/>
   What's the point of them all
   <br/>
   When you know that they'll fall?
   <br/>
   Through the trees those fallen leaves
   <br/>
   I won't cry when they're gone
   <br/>
   'Cause I'll just carry on without you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I could write a thousand songs of love to you
   <br/>
   But would you listen?
   <br/>
   What's a song when no one's singing?
   <br/>
   And if our story fades away
   <br/>
   There's really nothing left to say
   <br/>
   Will I waste all of my words on someone new?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   What if you leave, my love?
   <br/>
   What if you leave?
   <br/>
   Will it ever be the same
   <br/>
   When someone calls out your name?
   <br/>
   Will it ever be the same again?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I could write a thousand words of love to you
   <br/>
   But would you listen?
   <br/>
   If you're gone, I'm going nowhere
   <br/>
   I could try to change the world for you
   <br/>
   If only you would ask me to
   <br/>
   Or would I just make the same mistakes again?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   What if you leave, my love?
   <br/>
   What if you leave?
   <br/>
   Will it ever be the same
   <br/>
   When someone calls out your name?
   <br/>
   Oh will it ever be the same
   <br/>
   When someone calls out your name?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   What if you leave, my love?
   <br/>
   What if you leave?
   <br/>
   What if you leave, my love?
   <br/>
   What if you leave?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Will it ever be the same
   <br/>
   When someone calls out your name?...
  </p>
