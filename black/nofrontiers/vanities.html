  <p align="center">
   Big, bad man's law doesn't carry much sway
   <br/>
   When you come around here
   <br/>
   You can still scratch my back
   <br/>
   And I can still change sides
   <br/>
   Don't carry no torch 'til you have it in type
   <br/>
   That I'm doing okay
   <br/>
   It's only one man's outlook
   <br/>
   It could be one more lie
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Look at it closely
   <br/>
   Counterfeit mostly
   <br/>
   Yesterday's brushwork
   <br/>
   Using yesterday's paint
   <br/>
   And everything that I believe
   <br/>
   And every note that you receive
   <br/>
   They're just vanities to you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Hear that Liverpool wind as I'm making my way
   <br/>
   For the very last time
   <br/>
   Is this a resurrection?
   <br/>
   Do you really care?
   <br/>
   I can't relish no kiss 'til I happen to hear
   <br/>
   Your honeycomb nouns
   <br/>
   Let you down so often
   <br/>
   I'll do the same again
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Look at it closely
   <br/>
   Counterfeit mostly
   <br/>
   Yesterday's stories
   <br/>
   It's the same all over the world
   <br/>
   And everything that I believe
   <br/>
   And every note that you receive
   <br/>
   They're just vanities to you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Busy, little bodies have a story to tell
   <br/>
   Even if it goes against the grain
   <br/>
   Tiny, little seeds have got an ocean to swell
   <br/>
   But who am I to rock the boat?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And everything that I believe
   <br/>
   And every note that you receive
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Look at it closely
   <br/>
   Counterfeit mostly
   <br/>
   Yesterday's brushwork
   <br/>
   Using yesterday's paint
   <br/>
   Look at it closely
   <br/>
   Counterfeit mostly
   <br/>
   Yesterday's stories
   <br/>
   It's the same all over the world
