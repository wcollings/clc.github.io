  <p align="center">
   It was one of those days when to shine was of no value
   <br/>
   One of those days when the language had no grace
   <br/>
   We were miles apart, and I stood there with my head spinning
   <br/>
   Just another poor soul trying hard not to lose faith
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We had it engraved, we had the key to a union
   <br/>
   But you wanted more, so we both kept on losing
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Fat valley of pain
   <br/>
   Fat valley of pain inside
   <br/>
   And this pain will not end
   <br/>
   'Cause loving you is what I was made for
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You were like one of those rainbows we glimpse for a few seconds
   <br/>
   One of those dreams that could last for a life long
   <br/>
   Now I'm quizzing myself, and it's always the same question
   <br/>
   Is it wrong to believe when the feeling so strong?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We had engraved, we had the key to a union
   <br/>
   But you wanted more, so we both kept on losing
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Fat valley of pain
   <br/>
   Fat valley of pain inside
   <br/>
   And this pain has no end
   <br/>
   'Cause loving you is what I was made for
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It's an ill-kept secret that something here's going wrong
   <br/>
   Oh but my helpless feelings, they keep on leading me on
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Fat valley of pain
   <br/>
   Fat valley of pain inside
   <br/>
   And this pain will not end
   <br/>
   'Cause loving you is what I was made for...
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
