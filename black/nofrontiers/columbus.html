  <p align="center">
   Better keep your distance from this whale
   <br/>
   Better keep your boat from going astray
   <br/>
   Find yourself a partner and treat them well
   <br/>
   Try to give them shelter night and day
   <br/>
   'Cause here in this blue light far away from the fireside
   <br/>
   Things can get twisted and crazy and crowded, you can't even feel right
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So you dream of Columbus every time that the panic starts
   <br/>
   You dream of Columbus with your maps and your beautiful charts
   <br/>
   You dream of Columbus with an ache in your travelling heart
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   See how the cormorant swoops and dives
   <br/>
   Must be some thrill to go that deep
   <br/>
   Down to the basement of this life
   <br/>
   Down to where the mermaid gently sleeps
   <br/>
   Not like here in this blue light far away from the fireside
   <br/>
   Where things can get twisted and haunted and crowded, you can't even feel all right
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So you dream of Columbus every time that the panic starts
   <br/>
   You dream of Columbus with your maps and your beautiful charts
   <br/>
   You dream of Columbus with an ache in your travelling heart
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And as tide must ebb and flow I am dragged down under
   <br/>
   And I wait the live-long day for an end to my hunger
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So I dream of Columbus every time that the panic starts
   <br/>
   I dream of Columbus with my maps and my beautiful charts
   <br/>
   I dream of Columbus, and there's peace in a travelling heart
   <br/>
   I dream of Columbus
  </p>
