  <p align="center">
   Last night I dreamed you were back again
   <br/>
   Larger than life again, holding me tight again
   <br/>
   Placing those same kisses on my brow
   <br/>
   Sweeter than ever now, Lord, I remember how
   <br/>
   Couldn't get enough of kissing
   <br/>
   Do you know how much I'm missing?
   <br/>
   No, you don't, but I do
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Days like a slow train trickle by
   <br/>
   Even the words that I write refuse to fly
   <br/>
   All that I can hear is your song haunting me
   <br/>
   Can't get the melody out of my head, you see
   <br/>
   Distractions I've been using
   <br/>
   Do you know how much you're losing?
   <br/>
   No, you don't, but I do
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I do and I wonder if I'm past the point of rescue
   <br/>
   And is no word from you at all the best that you can do?
   <br/>
   Never meant to push or shove you
   <br/>
   Do you know how much I love you?
   <br/>
   No, you don't, but I do
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Last night I dreamed you were back again
   <br/>
   Larger than life again, holding me tight again
   <br/>
   Placing those same kisses on my brow
   <br/>
   Sweeter than ever now, Lord, I remember how
   <br/>
   Couldn't get enough of kissing
   <br/>
   Do you know how much I'm missing?
   <br/>
   No, you don't, but I do
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   No, you don't, but I do...
  </p>
