  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The moon was full and their hearts were empty
   <br/>
   When I stopped to watch the river go down
   <br/>
   Saw the gleaming eyes on your blind two corners
   <br/>
   Heard the shuffle of the buckled as they come to lay their money down
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Not even with his money down
   <br/>
   And he fades in the shadows of the walls of night in this town
   <br/>
   He just fades in the shadows of the walls of night in this town
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   My heart was numb and my eyes stopped running
   <br/>
   And the wind chilled my bones where I stopped to watch that river go down
   <br/>
   And the song on this street boasts no chest-proud anthem
   <br/>
   It's the shuffle of the buckled as they come to lay their money down
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Not even with his money down
   <br/>
   And he fades in the shadows of the walls of night in this town
   <br/>
   He just fades in the shadows of the walls of night in this town
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The moon was full and their hearts were empty
   <br/>
   When I stopped to watch the river go down
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Not even with his money down
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
