   Hey little brother, the winds of the world
   <br/>
   Have ruffled your soft and weakened wings
   <br/>
   And though I can't hold you as I look into your eyes
   <br/>
   I can see the film that disappointment brings
   <br/>
   I know it's rained upon your childhood dreams
   <br/>
   The games you've been playing weren't quite what they seemed
   <br/>
   How can I tell you don't bang your head against the wall
   <br/>
   The wall I've been banging and praying might fall?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Your time will come on another day
   <br/>
   And your dreams will flame and in the fire play
   <br/>
   On another day
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I know it's hard for you to understand
   <br/>
   There are no flying angels come to lend a hand
   <br/>
   No smiling faces lined for you to meet
   <br/>
   It looks like that in twisted glass from the kind side of the street
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   On another day
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Hey little brother, the winds of the world
   <br/>
   Have ruffled your soft and weakened wings
   <br/>
   And though I can't hold you as I look into your eyes
   <br/>
   I can see the film that disappointment brings
   <br/>
   I know it's rained upon your childhood dreams
   <br/>
   The games you've been playing weren't quite what they seemed
   <br/>
   How can I tell you don't bang your head against the wall
   <br/>
   The wall I've been banging and praying might fall?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   On another day
   <br/>
   On another day
  </p>
