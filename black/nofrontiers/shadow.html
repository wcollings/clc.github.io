  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It's over now, the guns have flowed
   <br/>
   The nightmare flashed on a cradle road
   <br/>
   As the guilty rain came down
   <br/>
   No child to hold through anxious fears
   <br/>
   No gentle hand to catch the tears
   <br/>
   That soak this ancient ground
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The smile that breaks so gently belies a troubled head
   <br/>
   Like the voice that holds the secrets of a life you might have led
   <br/>
   Eyes with pale indifference in danger and in grace
   <br/>
   But the glance that knows the death-knell left its shadow on your face
   <br/>
   In the deep, enduring darkness as your loyal friends go down
   <br/>
   Touched by the violent crown 'til their hunter's hunted down
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The web is slowly woven, the endless dreamer shed
   <br/>
   In the dawn, the curfew is broken on the Sunday morning's dead
   <br/>
   Centuries of thunder take the castle in the flood
   <br/>
   To the cold night air of London where your hands are bound in blood
   <br/>
   Midwinter deepened as the parting turned inside
   <br/>
   A thousand times you cried, but the shadow never died
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And it's over now, the guns have flowed
   <br/>
   The nightmare flashed on a cradle road
   <br/>
   As the guilty rain came down
   <br/>
   No child to hold through anxious fears
   <br/>
   No gentle hand, no graceful years
   <br/>
   Just bitter ancient ground
   <br/>
   It's over now
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
