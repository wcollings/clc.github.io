  <p align="center">
   I skimmed across black water
   <br/>
   Without once submerging
   <br/>
   Onto the banks of an urban morning
   <br/>
   That hungers the first light
   <br/>
   Much, much more than mountains ever do
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And she, like a ghost beside me
   <br/>
   Goes down with the ease of a dolphin
   <br/>
   And emerges unlearned, unshamed, unharmed
   <br/>
   For she is the perfect creature, natural in every feature
   <br/>
   And I am the geek with the alchemists' stone
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   For all of you who must discover
   <br/>
   For all who seek to understand
   <br/>
   For having left the path of others
   <br/>
   You'll find a very special hand
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And it is a holy thing
   <br/>
   And it is a precious time
   <br/>
   And it is the only way
   <br/>
   Forget-me-nots among the snow
   <br/>
   It's always been, and so it goes
   <br/>
   To ponder his death and his life eternally
  </p>

  <p align="center">
   One bright blue rose outlives all those
   <br/>
   Two thousand years, and still it goes
   <br/>
   To ponder his death and his life eternally
