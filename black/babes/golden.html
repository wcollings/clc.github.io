  <p align="center">
   Walkin' along golden mile with a soldier's twirl
   <br/>
   I must be the luckiest soul in the whole wide world
   <br/>
   Oh foolish thing, here I go again
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There's no faith more innocent than blind faith, and that's all I've got
   <br/>
   So I'm scaling the walls of my dreams, ready or not
   <br/>
   Oh foolish thing, here I go again
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Don't be afraid, darling, no need to be afraid, darling
   <br/>
   You don't have to be afraid from now on
   <br/>
   It's just the way, darling, we get delayed, darling
   <br/>
   But we won't be delayed from now on
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I know no power on earth nor up above
   <br/>
   That would alter the way things are, you are my love
   <br/>
   Yes, you're my pride and joy on the golden mile
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   If only it could be captured
   <br/>
   how I feel for you
   <br/>
   And if I could just freeze it, I feel I'd never be untrue
   <br/>
   Oh foolish thing, here I go
   <br/>
   Here I go again
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Don't be afraid, darling, no need to be afraid, darling
   <br/>
   You don't have to be afraid from now on
   <br/>
   It's just the way, darling, we get delayed, darling
   <br/>
   But we won't be delayed from now on
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I know no power on earth nor up above
   <br/>
   That would alter the way things are, you are my love
   <br/>
   You're my pride and joy, my pride and joy
   <br/>
   Yes, you're my pride and joy on the golden mile
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Walkin' along golden mile with a soldier's twirl
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
