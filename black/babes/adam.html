  <p align="center">
   Adam's at the window staring at the apple trees on fire
   <br/>
   Waiting for the windfall that brings the smile of kings and their desire
   <br/>
   Door blows in behind him, a floral pattern, summer dress so gay
   <br/>
   Burning in the sunlight, too late to wait, for darkenss won't delay
   <br/>
   To steal her cherry lips away
   <br/>
   For while the careless tongues of sunlight slowly trickle down
   <br/>
   The curve of hips, her fingertips, in kissing sips we drown
   <br/>
   In kissing sips we drown
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And Adam will have his way
   <br/>
   Adam will have his way
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Adam's on the island, living in the land of love
   <br/>
   Shadows lurk around him, drunk on the royal jelly of pure love
   <br/>
   Full and ripe, the fruit hang, for when the prince arrives he will want more
   <br/>
   And more and more he will drink from the canvas cup
   <br/>
   The son of a swan will then loose his plumera
   <br/>
   And he will wear a new age suit and haunt the joints in town
   <br/>
   And play a silver magic flute and call his lovers down
   <br/>
   And call his lovers down
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And Adam will have his way
   <br/>
   Adam will have his way
   <br/>
   Will have his way
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Adam's at the easel painting in the wrinkles and the gray
   <br/>
   Waiting for November, easy with the darkness of the day
   <br/>
   Smiles a tear of gladness, and Adam's at the window once again
   <br/>
   He's burning in the sunlight, too late to wait, for darkness won't delay
   <br/>
   To steal her cherry lips away
   <br/>
   For while the careless tongues of sunlight slowly trickle down
   <br/>
   The curve of hips, her fingertips, in kissing sips we drown
   <br/>
   In kissing sips we drown
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And Adam will have his way...
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Adam's at the window
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
