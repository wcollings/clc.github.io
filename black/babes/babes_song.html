   </b>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Babes in the wood walking through snow
   <br/>
   Big, bad wolf at the window
   <br/>
   Not much choice in the matter now
   <br/>
   Some must lead, some must follow
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And touch can mean distance to some people
   <br/>
   Touch can mean prison or be like a cage
   <br/>
   I always thought that life could be more simple
   <br/>
   Especially in this day and age
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   They got the time, they got the need
   <br/>
   The world's getting weird, the wolf's running free
   <br/>
   But that's another story, this is their story
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Babes in the wood, eager and keen
   <br/>
   Soft as the fern underneath them
   <br/>
   Wet to the skin from their own hot glow
   <br/>
   No more wolf at the window
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Touch can mean distance to some people
   <br/>
   And touch can mean I own you forever and a day
   <br/>
   If only life could be more simple
   <br/>
   Especially in this day and age
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But touch can be a blessing to other people
   <br/>
   And touch can bring blossom to things that decay
   <br/>
   I think life should be that simple
   <br/>
   Especially in this day and age
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
