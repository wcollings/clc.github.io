   Lying here, watching the time pass
   <br/>
   I could think of a million things I'd rather do
   <br/>
   Travel at my own pace
   <br/>
   Put myself asleep if I wanted to
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Might as well be behind bars
   <br/>
   Than be lashed to a wave that I can't haul
   <br/>
   I might as well be a slave
   <br/>
   Lying low in the shade of a prison wall
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Lying here, watching the time pass
   <br/>
   I could cry for the helping hands that I refused
   <br/>
   We were good friends
   <br/>
   But I did refuse
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Might as well be behind bars
   <br/>
   Getting used to the sound of my keeper's call
   <br/>
   I might as well be a slave
   <br/>
   Drinking sun through a chink in a prison wall
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Down here, down where the end is
   <br/>
   You absolve me from every crime I ever planned
   <br/>
   I was so surprised
   <br/>
   I did not think that you would understand
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Might as well be behind bars
   <br/>
   Growing old in a carpeted hall
   <br/>
   I might as well be a slave
   <br/>
   Always safe out of the rain in prison walls
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh I might as well be behind bars
   <br/>
   Getting used to the sound of my keeper's call
   <br/>
   I might as well be a slave
   <br/>
   Drinking sun through a chink in a prison wall
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
