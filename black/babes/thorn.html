     Lyrics

   </b>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Its taste was sweet like summer wine
   <br/>
   The heart that beats in double time
   <br/>
   He waltzed right in, he bowled you over
   <br/>
   You're still reeling from the feeling when he's gone
   <br/>
   The door is closed, the lock is turned
   <br/>
   And all the memories and letters have been burned
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   So when you pick the handsome flower
   <br/>
   Don't forget the thorn upon the rose
   <br/>
   Its cut is deep and its scar lasts forever
   <br/>
   It follows love wherever love goes
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Just how we fall, it's hard to know
   <br/>
   When what we feel, we seldom show
   <br/>
   So we show the parts we feel are best
   <br/>
   We squirm around the edges trying to cover up the rest
   <br/>
   And you think you know him, and he thinks the same
   <br/>
   When underneath it all, it's just a crazy guessing game
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Win or lose, it's just the same
   <br/>
   Tears of joy, tears of pain
   <br/>
   They're hand in hand, they come as one
   <br/>
   You'll never see the moon without the promise of the sun
   <br/>
   For all the bruises, for all the blows
   <br/>
   I'd rather feel the thorn than to never see the rose
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It follows love wherever love goes
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
