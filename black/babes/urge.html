  <p align="center">
   Well, I woke up today and found frost perched on the town
   <br/>
   It hovered in a frozen sky and gobbled summer down
   <br/>
   And when the sun turned straight and cold
   <br/>
   And shivering trees are standing in a naked row
   <br/>
   I get the urge for going, but I never seem to go
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I had someone in the summertime with summer-colored skin
   <br/>
   And not another one in town my darling's heart could win
   <br/>
   And when the leaves fell tumbling down
   <br/>
   And bully winds did rub their faces in the snow
   <br/>
   He got the urge for going, and I had to let him go
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, he got the urge for going
   <br/>
   When the meadow grasses are turning brown
   <br/>
   Summertime is a-falling down
   <br/>
   Winter's closing in
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And the warriors of winter gave a cold, triumphant shout
   <br/>
   All that stays is dying, and all that lives is getting out
   <br/>
   You see the geese in chevron flight
   <br/>
   A-flapping and a-racing on before the snow
   <br/>
   They've got the urge for going and they've got the wings to go
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   They've got the urge for going
   <br/>
   When the meadow grasses are turning brown
   <br/>
   Summertime is a-falling down
   <br/>
   Winter's closing in
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I'll pile the fire with kindling and pull the blankets to my chin
   <br/>
   I'll lock the vagrant winter out and bolt my wandering in
   <br/>
   I'd like to call back summertime
   <br/>
   And let her stay for just another month or so
   <br/>
   But she's got the urge for going, and I'll have to let her go
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She's got the urge for going
   <br/>
   When the meadow grasses are turning brown
   <br/>
   Summertime is a-falling down
   <br/>
   Winter's closing in
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, she's got the urge for going
   <br/>
   When the meadow grasses are turning brown
   <br/>
   All her empires are falling down
   <br/>
   Winter is closing in
  </p>
