  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I saw you in the reeds by the river
   <br/>
   Looked to me like you were having fun
   <br/>
   Can't decide if I was only dreaming
   <br/>
   I know you'll tell me all when I come
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I'm passing through the pearly gates
   <br/>
   I don't know why I feel so good
   <br/>
   I'm entering a far better place
   <br/>
   They tell me it's the land of love
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I wish that you'd been there to see the horses
   <br/>
   You would not believe how they danced
   <br/>
   The meadow seemed on fire with their playing
   <br/>
   And me, I just stood there entranced
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I'm passing through the pearly gates
   <br/>
   I can't say why I feel so good
   <br/>
   I'm entering a far better place
   <br/>
   'Cause I'm living in the land of love
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And if I do ever find what it is that you seek
   <br/>
   You can bet that I'll keep you informed
   <br/>
   It's only just after all, 'cause in times of unease
   <br/>
   You were always on hand to keep me warm
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   A woman sits and stares into the distance
   <br/>
   Her hands sitting pretty on her knees
   <br/>
   She gazes on the view before her
   <br/>
   She wonders what goes on behind the trees
   <br/>
   There's so much going on behind the trees
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She's passing through the pearly gates
   <br/>
   She can't say why she feels this good
   <br/>
   She's entering a far better place
   <br/>
   She's living in the land of love
   <br/>
   An angel in the land of love
   <br/>
   She's so happy in the land of love
   <br/>
   Let's go to the land of love
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
