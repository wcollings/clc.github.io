     Lyrics

  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I've been searching through other people's words
   <br/>
   Looking for direction
   <br/>
   I've been trying to get into their worlds
   <br/>
   Without satisfaction
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So don't go changing your troubled mind again
   <br/>
   Gotta make decisions
   <br/>
   Don't go waiting on middle ground when
   <br/>
   It's not a safe position
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Though you've lost all you received
   <br/>
   It's not what you got, it's what you believe in
   <br/>
   Though you've forgot all you need
   <br/>
   You've gotta stand up for what you believe in
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   A lack of something is evident again
   <br/>
   I feel I must explain
   <br/>
   'Cause I feel nothing but frustration and pain
   <br/>
   That I can't contain
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus 2x)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Don't leave me behind
   <br/>
   Out of sight is out of mind
   <br/>
   Please don't let me stray
   <br/>
   I know I'll be okay
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So now I see I've gotta get off of this fence
   <br/>
   My mind's made up now
   <br/>
   'Cause I feel free, and my soul can make amends
   <br/>
   For all this doubt
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Though you've lost all you received
   <br/>
   It's not what you got, it's what you believe in
   <br/>
   Though you've forgot all you need
   <br/>
   You've gotta stand up for what you believe
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Believe...
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
