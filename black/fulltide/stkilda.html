   </b>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Your famous philosophies
   <br/>
   Tied up in brown paper wrapping and string
   <br/>
   You stepped back through time like the time that you stepped through meant nothing at all
   <br/>
   A little bit weary and world worn and eager for taking some more
   <br/>
   And we leaned on each other like brothers and fought with our backs to the wall
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   We took no routine stance
   <br/>
   We were living our lives by chance
   <br/>
   Robbing Peter for Paul, losing it all
   <br/>
   Maybe I'll find you one Saturday night in St. Kilda again
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We were wrong the world didn't end between there and here
   <br/>
   Thought it's still looking shaky and worn
   <br/>
   Did you give up your dreaming, believing time finds a price for us all?
   <br/>
   Time is an enemy, patient and clever, and way beyond our control
   <br/>
   When you run out of time, it's funny, but money can't talk at all
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When the world turned rough and betrayed your trust
   <br/>
   And they left you out in the cold
   <br/>
   In the deafening silence, a man is an island when he's out on his own
   <br/>
   A little bit weary and world worn, not eager for talking anymore
   <br/>
   Hey brother, what happened to standing and fighting with our backs to the wall?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We took no routine stance
   <br/>
   We were living our lives by chance
   <br/>
   Robbing Peter for Paul, losing it all
   <br/>
   Maybe I'll find you one Saturday night
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   This old town again
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
 </body>
