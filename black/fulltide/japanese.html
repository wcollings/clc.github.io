  <p align="center">
   Pacific looking blue
   <br/>
   My loved one looking fine
   <br/>
   This is how it should be
   <br/>
   All of the time
   <br/>
   Dry berth by the ocean
   <br/>
   Hey, this is real good
   <br/>
   Maybe we can stay together
   <br/>
   In Japanese Deluxe
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I noticed the leaves this morning
   <br/>
   It made me stop to think
   <br/>
   So caught up in the days was I
   <br/>
   Days without a link
   <br/>
   I bow down to the totems
   <br/>
   I bow down to look up
   <br/>
   Just 'cause I want to stay together
   <br/>
   In Japanese Deluxe
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Just 'cause I want to stay together
   <br/>
   In this boat they call Deluxe
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But lately it seems we've both been thinking
   <br/>
   That it's time for us to part
   <br/>
   But who knows, if we hang on
   <br/>
   We might, we might make a second start
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The bogeyman is out there someplace
   <br/>
   Making people scared
   <br/>
   He's going to call on us, too
   <br/>
   Unless we have a care
   <br/>
   It takes more than devotion
   <br/>
   It takes more than good luck
   <br/>
   It takes a lot to stay together
   <br/>
   On Japanese Deluxe
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   A lot more than devotion
   <br/>
   A lot more than good looks
   <br/>
   That's if we want to stay together
   <br/>
   In Japanese Deluxe
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I hope we get to stay together
   <br/>
   In this boat they call Deluxe
  </p>
