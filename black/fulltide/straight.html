  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She roots out her best earrings with a comb
   <br/>
   The ones that go with her rowdy red hair
   <br/>
   Weaves her way between the plastic and the bones
   <br/>
   Leaves all her empty evenings hanging in the air
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And he don't mind that she's a short-tempered girl
   <br/>
   He don't mind that she may soon say good-bye
   <br/>
   He don't mind 'cause she's got something he loves
   <br/>
   She's as straight as a die
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She sees the men out changing the state
   <br/>
   Knows they stoop, though her eyes are half-drowned
   <br/>
   Hear the steeple say it's a quarter past eight
   <br/>
   Moves on in a hurry, well, she's a long way from town
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He don't mind that she's a short-tempered girl
   <br/>
   He don't mind that she may soon make him cry
   <br/>
   He don't mind 'cause she's got something he loves
   <br/>
   She's as straight as a die
   <br/>
   Straight as a die
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We won't get away from this either
   <br/>
   No matter how hard we try
   <br/>
   The truth is there to catch us
   <br/>
   The truth is going to save our lives
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He's in a thrill of anticipation
   <br/>
   So glad he bought something small to give her for a gift
   <br/>
   He feels kind of silly in case she thinks he's having her on
   <br/>
   All he meant was, she's got a friend she can kiss
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And he don't mind that she's a short-tempered girl
   <br/>
   He don't mind that she may soon have to fly
   <br/>
   He don't mind 'cause she's got something he loves
   <br/>
   She's as straight as a die
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Straight as a die...
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
