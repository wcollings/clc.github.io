  <p align="center">
   How can I say what I feel?
   <br/>
   When I turn around, you're not here
   <br/>
   I know it's my time to lead
   <br/>
   But the emptiness inside leaves me weak
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Then in a moment, it all becomes so clear
   <br/>
   All I ever wanted was waiting right here
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So now I see, now you've been freed
   <br/>
   You'll always be near like you were all those years
   <br/>
   And now I breathe the life you gave
   <br/>
   'Cause I've learned from the best
   <br/>
   And I'll always be blessed with your love
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We gathered 'round for your last breath
   <br/>
   Talked with you while you slept
   <br/>
   Somehow I know you'll be all right
   <br/>
   Perfect end to a perfect life
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Then in a moment, it all becomes so clear
   <br/>
   I want so much to tell you, but you're no longer here
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So now I see, now you've been freed
   <br/>
   You'll always be near like you were all those years
   <br/>
   And now I breathe the life you leave
   <br/>
   'Cause I've learned from the best
   <br/>
   And I've always been blessed with your love
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And now I see, now you've been freed
   <br/>
   That you'll always be near like you were all those years
   <br/>
   And now I breathe the life you gave
   <br/>
   'Cause I've learned from the best
   <br/>
   And I've always been blessed with your love
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Your love...
