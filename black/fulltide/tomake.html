  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When the rain is blowing in your face
   <br/>
   And the whole world is on your case
   <br/>
   I could offer you a warm embrace
   <br/>
   To make you feel my love
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When evening shadows and the stars appear
   <br/>
   And there's no one there to dry your tears
   <br/>
   I could hold you for a million years
   <br/>
   To make you feel my love
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I know you haven't made your mind up yet
   <br/>
   But I would never do you wrong
   <br/>
   I've known that from the moment that we met
   <br/>
   No doubt in my mind where you belong
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
   <br/>
   I'd go crawling down the avenue
   <br/>
   No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
   <br/>
   To make you feel my love
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The storms are raging on the rolling sea
   <br/>
   And on the highway of regret
   <br/>
   The winds of change are blowing wild and free
   <br/>
   Oh you ain't seen nothing like me yet
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
   <br/>
   There's nothing that I wouldn't do
   <br/>
   Go to the ends of the earth for you
   <br/>
   To make you feel my love
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When the rain is blowing in your face
   <br/>
   And the whole world is on your case
   <br/>
   I could offer you a warm embrace
   <br/>
   To make you feel my love
  </p>
