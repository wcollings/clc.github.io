   Your hands are cold, lover
   <br/>
   Where have you been?
   <br/>
   We don't need persuasion
   <br/>
   You just need a sin
   <br/>
   We can differ though the hours of the night
   <br/>
   That's no big thing
   <br/>
   Ah but give me one embrace
   <br/>
   And I'll stop all my talking
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The real you is there to see
   <br/>
   The real you is the one for me
   <br/>
   All through this rocky ride
   <br/>
   Let's do our bit in this full tide
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Life gets so serious
   <br/>
   There's no time to play
   <br/>
   I don't want any blessing
   <br/>
   'Cause I spy you headed my way
   <br/>
   I could carve your name down on a stone
   <br/>
   That's no big thing
   <br/>
   Ah but when I see your face
   <br/>
   There's no need for talking
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The real you is there to see
   <br/>
   The real you is the one for me
   <br/>
   All through this rocky ride
   <br/>
   Let's do our best in this full tide
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I was lost in a fog
   <br/>
   Living in a world I never knew about
   <br/>
   Now I'm standing in a place
   <br/>
   And heaven's all around, the shadows have all washed out
   <br/>
   The shadows have all washed out
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh what paradise is this?
   <br/>
   The words of welcome on your lips
   <br/>
   The stamp of certainty in all your steps
   <br/>
   You're here to save me from this slow death
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The real you is there to see
   <br/>
   The real you is the one for me
   <br/>
   All through this rocky ride
   <br/>
   Let's do our best in this full
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The real you is there to see
   <br/>
   The real you has the best of me
   <br/>
   Gods loves even the poorest life
   <br/>
   So let's do our bit in this full tide
   <br/>
   In this full tide
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
