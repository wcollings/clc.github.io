  <p align="center">
   Everybody else has gone
   <br/>
   But you're still here with me
   <br/>
   All the world is sleeping by and by
   <br/>
   Through the windowpane
   <br/>
   The frosted light is streaming in
   <br/>
   Full moon sailing high across the sky
   <br/>
   Tonight is like the night when we first met
   <br/>
   I always knew I never would forget you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Come and hold me close
   <br/>
   I miss you more than I can say
   <br/>
   I can't imagine how I pass the time
   <br/>
   Wondering if you'll ever know
   <br/>
   How much you mean to me
   <br/>
   I never dreamed there'd be a change of mind
   <br/>
   Oh lover, this is where I want to stay
   <br/>
   Maybe it could always be this way
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Gentle music, rock away the sadnesses in me
   <br/>
   Rock away my lonely yesterdays
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I recall you said to me
   <br/>
   A long, long time ago
   <br/>
   "Don't you lose direction in the crowd, I think you could"
   <br/>
   But when I did you found me
   <br/>
   And I didn't even know
   <br/>
   Hardly even knew you were around, and understood
   <br/>
   I was reaching out each moment to be free
   <br/>
   You were all those things I'd never be
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Gentle music, rock away the sadnesses in me
   <br/>
   Rock away my lonely yesterdays
   <br/>
   Like pennies on the ocean
   <br/>
   'Til no trace of them I see
   <br/>
   'Til moonlight shows no ripples on the waves
   <br/>
   And then the clear reflection will remain
   <br/>
   Perhaps the same reflection of that same full moon
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Full moon...
  </p>
