  <p align="center">
   He don't know how to lie
   <br/>
   Or undermine you
   <br/>
   He don't know how to steal
   <br/>
   How to deal or deceive
   <br/>
   So leave him alone, set him free
   <br/>
   'Cause he's speaking with the angel
   <br/>
   Speaking with the angel that only he can see
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You say he's so helpless
   <br/>
   Well, what about you?
   <br/>
   You don't pull the strings
   <br/>
   Don't you know anything?
   <br/>
   Just leave him alone, let him be
   <br/>
   'Cause he's speaking with the angel
   <br/>
   Speaking with the angel that only he can see
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Would you teach him about heaven?
   <br/>
   Would you show him how to love the earth?
   <br/>
   Would you poison him with prejudice
   <br/>
   From the moment of his birth?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He in the name of love
   <br/>
   He in the blood of the lamb
   <br/>
   He that never lays blame
   <br/>
   He don't even know his name
   <br/>
   Just leave him alone, set him free
   <br/>
   'Cause he's speaking with the angel
   <br/>
   Speaking with the angel
   <br/>
   The very one that spoke to you and me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh do you remember?
  </p>
