  <p align="center">
   You'll remember me when the west wind moves
   <br/>
   Among the fields of barley
   <br/>
   You can tell the sun in his jealous sky
   <br/>
   As you walk in fields of gold
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So she took her love for to gaze awhile
   <br/>
   Upon the fields of barley
   <br/>
   In his arms she fell as her hair came down
   <br/>
   Among the fields of gold
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Will you stay with me? Will you be my love?
   <br/>
   Among the fields of barley
   <br/>
   You can tell the sun in his jealous sky
   <br/>
   As you lie in fields of gold
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I never made promises lightly
   <br/>
   And there have been some that I've broken
   <br/>
   But I swear in the days still left
   <br/>
   We'll walk in fields of gold
   <br/>
   We'll walk in fields of gold
   <br/>
   (2x)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Many years have passed since those summer days
   <br/>
   Among the fields of barley
   <br/>
   See the children run as the sun goes down
   <br/>
   Among the fields of gold
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You'll remember me when the west wind moves
   <br/>
   Among the fields of barley
   <br/>
   You can tell the sun in his jealous sky
   <br/>
   When we walked in fields of gold
   <br/>
   When we walked in fields of gold
   <br/>
   When we walked in fields of gold
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
