  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The letter stopped in a minor key
   <br/>
   A Christmas card that you drew for me
   <br/>
   Done by the hand that I knew so well
   <br/>
   Disguised the message that you could not tell
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I see you bent above your potter's wheel
   <br/>
   The piece you're throwing is the piece you feel
   <br/>
   The softest color and an eye so true
   <br/>
   For cups and bowls that are shaped like you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You work in porcelain cut by wire
   <br/>
   Now as ever lovers walk through fire
   <br/>
   When we were breaking, we made no sound
   <br/>
   The pieces almost touching on the ground
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And now your silence says there's someone there
   <br/>
   She stands behind you as she strokes your hair
   <br/>
   How does she hold you, like a long lost friend?
   <br/>
   Or are you like me, on your own again?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And so I write you in a minor key
   <br/>
   Wondering if there's something left for me
   <br/>
   I'm only writing so that I can sleep
   <br/>
   I never found another love as deep
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You work in porcelain cut by wire
   <br/>
   Now as ever lovers walk through fire
   <br/>
   When we were breaking, we made no sound
   <br/>
   The pieces almost touching on the ground
   <br/>
   (2x)
  </p>
