  <p align="center">
   I'm giving up on TV, it's not making sense
   <br/>
   Gotta trust ourselves, it's the last line of defence
   <br/>
   Spinning into space, running out of time
   <br/>
   Gathering together all the useful things we find
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So don't say okay and be half-hearted
   <br/>
   'Cause I'm afraid that this feeling goes on
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Sacrifice the world, face a killing sun
   <br/>
   You gotta get it all together, it'll bring us all undone
   <br/>
   We're running up hills that we already climbed
   <br/>
   Over the top and falling down the other side
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So don't say okay and be half-hearted
   <br/>
   'Cause I'm afraid that this feeling's too strong
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The ghosts are at the window, they're back again tonight
   <br/>
   They're looking in on us, so we've got to get it right
   <br/>
   We're walking on their bones everywhere we go
   <br/>
   Spirits in the wind and the memories in the stones
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So don't say okay and be half-hearted
   <br/>
   'Cause I'm afraid that this feeling goes on
   <br/>
   So don't say okay and be half-hearted
   <br/>
   'Cause I'm afraid that this feeling's too strong
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   How we gonna get the healing done?
  </p>
