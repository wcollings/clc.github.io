   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   In darkness we do what we can
   <br/>
   In daylight we're oblivion
   <br/>
   Our hearts so raw and clear
   <br/>
   Are turning away, turning away from here
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   On water we have walked like the fearless child
   <br/>
   What was fastened, we've unlocked revealing wondrous wild
   <br/>
   And in search of confirmation we have jumped into the fire
   <br/>
   And scrambled with our burning feet through uncontrolled desire
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There's a well upon the hill from our ancient past
   <br/>
   Where an age is standing still, holding strong and fast
   <br/>
   And there's those that try to tame it and to carve it into stone
   <br/>
   But words cannot extinguish it, however hard they're thrown
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   On Racherie they have worked with their island dreams
   <br/>
   By Lough Cleggan they have nourished in mountain streams
   <br/>
   And in searching for acceptance they had given it away
   <br/>
   Only the children of their children know the price they had to pay
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus 2x)
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
