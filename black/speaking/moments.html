  <p align="center">
   These are the moments that we love so well
   <br/>
   Precious moments caught within a spell
   <br/>
   All too soon our lives, they fade away
   <br/>
   These are the moments that we wish would stay
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   If I had my life to live again
   <br/>
   I would choose to be with you, my friend
   <br/>
   Time moves slowly and it goes so fast
   <br/>
   And who knows how long the days will last?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So cherish deep within you the love you get today
   <br/>
   Let the moment linger 'cause tomorrow steals that away
   <br/>
   Yes, tomorrow steals that away
   <br/>
   (2x)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   These are the memories that we made so well
   <br/>
   Lives like stories that we long to tell
   <br/>
   When we're old with not too much to say
   <br/>
   We'll have the memories that we made today
   <br/>
   Oh we'll have the memories that we made today
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
