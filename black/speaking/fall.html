  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I'm really close tonight
   <br/>
   I feel like I'm moving inside him
   <br/>
   Lying in the dark
   <br/>
   I think that I'm beginning to know him
   <br/>
   Let it go, I'll be there when you call
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   And whenever I fall at your feet
   <br/>
   Won't you let your tears rain down on me?
   <br/>
   Whenever I touch your slow, turning pain
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Don't hide it from me now
   <br/>
   There's something in the way that you're talking
   <br/>
   Words don't sound right
   <br/>
   I hear them all moving inside you
   <br/>
   You know, I'll be waiting when you call
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The finger of blame has turning upon itself
   <br/>
   And I'm more than willing to offer myself
   <br/>
   Do you want my presence or need my help?
   <br/>
   Who knows where that might lead
   <br/>
   I fall
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I fall at your feet
   <br/>
   Fall at your feet
  </p>
