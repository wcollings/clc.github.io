  <p align="center">
   Remember when we walked on hills of heather, singing, weaving mystical rings
   <br/>
   Now in a while, my precious child, you will unfurl your wings
   <br/>
   And I'll have lost what I believed, had promised everything
   <br/>
   But before you go, my friend, my kind companion, listen to this song I sing
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Then go in peace and grow in grace and goodness, know that you have nothing to fear
   <br/>
   And dry your eyes, my little one, and let there be no tears
   <br/>
   Send me a dream from away beyond, I promise I shall hear
   <br/>
   Oh beautiful, beloved soul companion, thank you for those beautiful years
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And heaven hold and watch your way forever, may your every dream come true
   <br/>
   Forgive all wrong, always be strong, and do what you must do
   <br/>
   You stand before this open door and you must now go through
   <br/>
   My precious friend, my own, my sweet companion, bless the road that carries you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   My precious friend, my own, my sweet companion, bless the road that carries you
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
