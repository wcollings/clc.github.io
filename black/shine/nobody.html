  <p align="center">
   Seemed like I'd gone off the side of a mountain
   <br/>
   Couldn't be sure I was even alive
   <br/>
   Fallen from the icy heights
   <br/>
   Landed with a broken cry
   <br/>
   In this valley of shadows and sorrow and sighs
   <br/>
   Can you save me, baby?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Nobody lives without love
   <br/>
   Nobody gets to give up
   <br/>
   You can try to lock your heart away
   <br/>
   But love will come back for you some day
   <br/>
   Nobody lives without love
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Thought I could live out my life as a stranger
   <br/>
   Hide from the heartbreak that love always brings
   <br/>
   Make it to the higher ground
   <br/>
   Try to turn the volume down
   <br/>
   Couldn't stop the sirens from singing
   <br/>
   Sing for me, baby
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You came along like a flash of pure lightning
   <br/>
   Crashed into my life like a runaway star
   <br/>
   Feel myself falling like gravity's angel
   <br/>
   Now I'm standing here offering a stranger my heart
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Seemed like I'd gone off the side of a mountain
   <br/>
   Couldn't be sure I was even alive
   <br/>
   Thought I could live out my life as a stranger
   <br/>
   Hide from the heartbreak that love always brings
   <br/>
   Seemed like I'd gone off the side of a mountain
   <br/>
   Couldn't be sure I was even alive
  </p>
