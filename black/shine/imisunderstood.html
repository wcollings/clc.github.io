  <p align="center">
   He said, "Darling, I'm in love with your mind
   <br/>
   The way you care for me, it's so kind
   <br/>
   Love to see you again, wish I had more time"
   <br/>
   He was laughing as he brushed my cheek
   <br/>
   "Why don't you call me, baby? Maybe next week
   <br/>
   Promise now, cross your heart and hope to die"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   But I misunderstood
   <br/>
   But I misunderstood
   <br/>
   But I misunderstood
   <br/>
   I thought he was saying, "Good luck"
   <br/>
   He was saying, "Good-bye"
   <br/>
   (2x)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Things I tried to put shine in his eyes
   <br/>
   Wire wheels and shimmering things
   <br/>
   Wild nights when the whole world seemed to fly
   <br/>
   He said, "The thing that's so unique
   <br/>
   When we're together, we don't have to speak
   <br/>
   We'll always be such good friends, you and I"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus...)
  </p>
