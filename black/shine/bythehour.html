  <p align="center">
   I was broken by the power
   <br/>
   I was swallowed by the need
   <br/>
   I was hiding in the corner
   <br/>
   When a voice called to me
   <br/>
   He understood my mystery
   <br/>
   Soothed the wounds of my despair
   <br/>
   With his grace he tenderly
   <br/>
   Brushed the tangles from my hair
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I'm feeling better by the hour
   <br/>
   I think I just might be okay
   <br/>
   Though bridges burn and ashes shower
   <br/>
   Think I can live with what remains
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   As I sorted through the wreckage
   <br/>
   Sitting in my silent fast
   <br/>
   On my bed of hard-earned ashes
   <br/>
   Still repenting for my past
   <br/>
   My body ached and shook with anger
   <br/>
   As I walked through narrow gates
   <br/>
   And I left those walls behind me
   <br/>
   And with them my mistakes
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I'm feeling better by the hour
   <br/>
   I think I just might be okay
   <br/>
   Though bridges burn and ashes shower
   <br/>
   Think I can live with what remains
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
