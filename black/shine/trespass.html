  <p align="center">
   When I see you coming
   <br/>
   In your trespass shoes
   <br/>
   Hear the song you're humming
   <br/>
   How can I refuse?
   <br/>
   With your half-drunk bottle
   <br/>
   And your slurring tongue
   <br/>
   Singing sentimental
   <br/>
   Don't it always make me feel so young
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Been alone, we've been together, we've stood at toe to toe
   <br/>
   Getting older doesn't matter when the light's down low
   <br/>
   When the push comes down to shoving, when the four winds blow
   <br/>
   Ain't nobody ever loved me like you do
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Now my heels are snagging
   <br/>
   On these pavement stones
   <br/>
   Days and nights are dragging
   <br/>
   'Til I get you home
   <br/>
   With your four o'clock shadow
   <br/>
   And your cowboy songs
   <br/>
   Singing sentimental
   <br/>
   Don't it always make me feel so strong
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Been alone, we've been together, we've stood at toe to toe
   <br/>
   Getting older doesn't matter when the light's down low
   <br/>
   Push comes to shove, and worse for better when the four winds blow
   <br/>
   Ain't nobody ever loved me like you do
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   With your forehead furrowed
   <br/>
   And your facts all wrong
   <br/>
   Oh so tempermental
   <br/>
   Oh but baby when it's said and done
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Been alone, we've been together, we've stood at toe to toe
   <br/>
   Getting older doesn't matter when the light's down low
   <br/>
   Push comes to shove, and worse for better, it only goes to show
   <br/>
   When the four winds blow
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Been alone, we've been together, we've stood at toe to toe
   <br/>
   Getting older doesn't matter when the light's down low
   <br/>
   Push comes to shove, and worse for better, it only goes to show
   <br/>
   Ain't nobody ever loved me like you do
   <br/>
   Ain't nobody ever loved me like you do
   <br/>
   Ain't nobody ever loved me like you do
