  <p align="center">
   When times are hard, and friends are few
   <br/>
   And you need someone to help you through
   <br/>
   Just call my name, and I'll come running to your side
   <br/>
   Don't be afraid, don't be afraid
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   I will be there
   <br/>
   When you are lost, lost in the night, nowhere to turn
   <br/>
   I will be there
   <br/>
   Don't be afraid, don't be afraid
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When morning comes, and nothing's changed
   <br/>
   And the world outside plays the same old game
   <br/>
   Just call on me, and I will ease your lonely heart
   <br/>
   Don't be afraid, don't be afraid
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I will be there
   <br/>
   When everyone that you believe still lets you down
   <br/>
   I will be there
   <br/>
   Don't be afraid, don't be afraid
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   'Cause I will be there, don't be afraid
   <br/>
   I will be there, don't be afraid
   <br/>
   I will be there
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When morning comes, and nothing's changed
   <br/>
   And the world outside plays the same old game
   <br/>
   When everyone still lets you down, I will be there
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When morning comes, and friends are few
   <br/>
   You need someone, you need someone to help you through
   <br/>
   I will be there, don't be afraid
   <br/>
   I will be there, don't be afraid
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I will be there
   <br/>
   When everyone that you believe still lets you down
   <br/>
   I will be there
   <br/>
   Don't be afraid, don't be afraid
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
