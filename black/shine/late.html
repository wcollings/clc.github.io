  <p align="center">
   Oh Mary Jane, she step on the train, head for the city lights
   <br/>
   Yearning inside to swim with the tide and taste it all right
   <br/>
   Bag on her shoulder, breathing the cold, there by the metal tracks
   <br/>
   She saw it all shine and swore in her mind she'd never go back
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   She don't mind the late night, late night radio
   <br/>
   She don't mind the late night radio
   <br/>
   She don't mind the late night, late night radio
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Couldn't have dreamed the things that she'd seen there on the avenue
   <br/>
   She stared right into a million eyes that looked her right through
   <br/>
   Telling red Joe, the places she'd go and wiping the table clean
   <br/>
   She got no idea the demon of fear or what a broken heart means
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Not at all...
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   New York was dark, dirty and stark, burning with yellow wings
   <br/>
   Everyday come with fever and hum, who knows what it brings?
   <br/>
   Walking a wall without a thought to fall and hit the ground
   <br/>
   Oh sweet Mary Jane with eyes like rain alive to the sound
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus 2x)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Not at all
   <br/>
   Not at all
  </p>
