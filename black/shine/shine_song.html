  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I can see it in your eyes what I know in my heart is true
   <br/>
   That our love, it has faded like the summer run through
   <br/>
   So we walk down the shoreline one last time together
   <br/>
   Feel the wind blow our wandering hearts like a feather
   <br/>
   But who knows who's waiting in the wings of time
   <br/>
   Dry your eyes, we're gonna go where we can shine
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Don't be hiding in sorrow or clinging to the past
   <br/>
   With your beauty so precious and the seasons so fast
   <br/>
   No matter how cold the horizon appears
   <br/>
   Or how far the first night when I held you near
   <br/>
   You've gotta rise from these ashes like a bird of flame
   <br/>
   Take my hand, we're gonna go where we can shine
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   For all that we struggle, for all we pretend
   <br/>
   It don't come down to nothing except love in the end
   <br/>
   And ours is a road that is strewn with good-byes
   <br/>
   But as it unfolds, as it all unwinds
   <br/>
   Remember your soul is the one thing you just can't compromise
   <br/>
   Step out of the shadows, you gotta go where we can shine
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh we're gonna go where we can shine...
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
