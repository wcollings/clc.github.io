  <p align="center">
   I do not see the way out
   <br/>
   I do not really know how
   <br/>
   Like a shot in the dark
   <br/>
   Went your hallowed ground
   <br/>
   Had you taken too much
   <br/>
   Kept me well out of touch
   <br/>
   And refused to let me go
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I cannot see to you pain
   <br/>
   I do not hear you complain
   <br/>
   You are now but a dot
   <br/>
   In the pouring rain
   <br/>
   You created this mess
   <br/>
   Now I'm bent to your stress
   <br/>
   And it seems to suit you well
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   One and only, two can be lonely
   <br/>
   I'm my own child, blessed and unholy
   <br/>
   In your eyes the storm surely rising up
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I do not see the way out
   <br/>
   You cannot turn this around
   <br/>
   Like a walk in the dark
   <br/>
   You have weighed me down
   <br/>
   I can't stand in your place
   <br/>
   Can't take this away
   <br/>
   It was all good to be true
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh you never talk about it
   <br/>
   No, you never scream about it
   <br/>
   You took a spirit, young and whole
   <br/>
   You turned this child into an old soul, old soul
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh you never talk about it
   <br/>
   No, you never scream about it
   <br/>
   You covet things that you don't own
   <br/>
   You turn this child into and old soul, old soul
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus 2x)
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
