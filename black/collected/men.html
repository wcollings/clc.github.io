  <p align="center">
   Leave the land behind, laddie, better days to find
   <br/>
   The companies have the money and they'll soon teach you the skills
   <br/>
   Green fields far away, lads, the forties and the brae
   <br/>
   Be a madman or a roustabout, they'll soon teach you to drill
   <br/>
   But who will tend me sheep when I'm far o'er the deep?
   <br/>
   On the Neptune or the Seaquest when the snow comes to the hill
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Leave the fishing trade, lads, there's money to be made
   <br/>
   The hard life and the Shetlands are all but bygone day
   <br/>
   Come to Aberdeen, lads, sights you've never seen
   <br/>
   Be a welder on the pipeline or a fitter at McVeigh
   <br/>
   But when the job is o'er and your boat rots on the shore
   <br/>
   How will you feed your family when the companies go away?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There's harbors to be built, lads, rigs to tow and tilt
   <br/>
   To rest upon the ocean bed like pylons in the sea
   <br/>
   Pipelines to be laid and a hundred different trades
   <br/>
   That'll pay a decent living wage to the likes of you and me
   <br/>
   I know you're men of worth, you're the best that's in the north
   <br/>
   Not men of greed, but men who need the work that's come your way
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   From Fluttock to Kishore a new industry is born
   <br/>
   Old Peterhead and Comarty will never be the same
   <br/>
   I know you're men of worth, you're the best that's in the north
   <br/>
   Not men of greed, but men who need the work that's come your way
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
