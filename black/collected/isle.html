  <p align="center">
   Now Boney's away from his warring and fighting
   <br/>
   He has gone to a place where nought can delight him
   <br/>
   He may sit now and tell of the sights he has seen
   <br/>
   While forlorn he does mourn on the Isle of St. Helena
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   No more in St. Claude will he appear in great splendor
   <br/>
   Nor step forth from the crowd like the great Alexander
   <br/>
   He may look to the east while he thinks on Lucana
   <br/>
   With his heart full of woe on the Isle of St. Helena
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The wild, rushing waves 'round our shores, they're a-washing
   <br/>
   And the white billows heave on our rocks, they're a-lashing
   <br/>
   He may look o'er the main to the great Mount Diana
   <br/>
   With his eyes on the waves that surround St. Helena
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Louise as she weeps, from her husband is parted
   <br/>
   And she dreams while she sleeps and awakes broken-hearted
   <br/>
   There is none to console her, though there's many would be with her
   <br/>
   While alone she does mourn when she thinks of St. Helena
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So all you that have wealth, beware of ambition
   <br/>
   For there's some twist of fate could soon change your condition
   <br/>
   Be steadfast in time, what's to come, change you cannot
   <br/>
   For maybe your race will end on the Isle of St. Helena
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
