  <p align="center">
   Oh come all ye maids who live at a distance
   <br/>
   Many's a mile from off your sway
   <br/>
   Come and assist me this very moment
   <br/>
   For to pass away some time
   <br/>
   Singing sweetly and completely
   <br/>
   Songs of pleasure and of love
   <br/>
   For me heart is with him altogether
   <br/>
   Though I live not where I love
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When I sleep, I dream about you
   <br/>
   When I wake, I take no rest
   <br/>
   Every moment thinking on you
   <br/>
   My heart o'er fixed in your breast
   <br/>
   But although far distance may be of assistance
   <br/>
   If from my mind your love remove
   <br/>
   For me heart is with him altogether
   <br/>
   Though I live not where I love
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   All the world shall be of one religion
   <br/>
   All living things shall cease to die
   <br/>
   If ever I should prove false to my jewel
   <br/>
   Or any way his love deny
   <br/>
   Oh the world shall change and be most strange
   <br/>
   If from my mind your love remove
   <br/>
   For me heart is with him altogether
   <br/>
   Though I live not where I love
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So farewell lads and farewell lassies
   <br/>
   Now I think I've made my choice
   <br/>
   I will away to yonder mountain
   <br/>
   Where I think I hear his voice
   <br/>
   And if he hollows I will follow
   <br/>
   Around the world though it is so wide
   <br/>
   For young Thomas, he did promise
   <br/>
   I should be his lawful bride
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh come all ye maids who live at a distance
   <br/>
   Many's a mile from off your sway
   <br/>
   Come and assist me this very moment
   <br/>
   For to pass away some time
   <br/>
   Singing sweetly and completely
   <br/>
   Songs of pleasure and of love
   <br/>
   For me heart is with him altogether
   <br/>
   Though I live not where I love
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
