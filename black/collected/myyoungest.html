   My youngest son came home today
   <br/>
   His friends marched with him all the way
   <br/>
   The pipes and drum beat out the time
   <br/>
   As in his box of polished pine
   <br/>
   Like dead meat on a butcher's tray
   <br/>
   My youngest son came home today
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   My youngest son was a fine young man
   <br/>
   With a wife, a daughter and two sons
   <br/>
   A man he would have lived and died
   <br/>
   'Til by a bullet sanctified
   <br/>
   Now he's a saint or so they say
   <br/>
   They brought their saint home today
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Above the narrow Belfast streets
   <br/>
   An Irish sky looks down and weeps
   <br/>
   At children's blood in gutters spilled
   <br/>
   In dreams of freedom unfulfilled
   <br/>
   As part of freedom's price to pay
   <br/>
   My youngest son came home today
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   My youngest son came home today
   <br/>
   His friends marched with him all the way
   <br/>
   The pipes and drums beat out the time
   <br/>
   As in his box of polished pine
   <br/>
   Like dead meat on a butcher's tray
   <br/>
   My youngest son came home today
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And this time he's home to stay
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
 </body>
