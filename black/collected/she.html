     Lyrics

  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I once had a sweetheart, I loved her right well
   <br/>
   I loved her far better than my tongue can tell
   <br/>
   Her parents did slight me for the want of guile
   <br/>
   Adieu to all pleasure since I lost my dear
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She went away from me and moved through the fair
   <br/>
   Where hand-clapping dealers' loud shouts rent the air
   <br/>
   The sunlight around her did sparkle and play
   <br/>
   Saying, "It will not be long, love, 'til our wedding day"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When dew falls on meadows and moths fill the night
   <br/>
   When glow from the greesach on half-froze, half-light
   <br/>
   I'll slip from my casement and I'll run away
   <br/>
   Then it will not be long, love, 'til our wedding day
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I dreamed last night that my love came in
   <br/>
   She came in so easy, her feet made no din
   <br/>
   She came stepping up to me and this she did say
   <br/>
   "It will not be long, love, 'til our wedding day"
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
