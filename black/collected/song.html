  <p align="center">
   Walking all the day
   <br/>
   Near tall towers where falcons build their nests
   <br/>
   Silver-winged they fly
   <br/>
   They know the call of freedom in their breasts
   <br/>
   Saw Black Head against the sky
   <br/>
   With twisted rocks that run down to the sea
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus (after each verse)
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Living on your western shore
   <br/>
   Saw summer sunsets, asked for more
   <br/>
   I stood by your Atlantic sea
   <br/>
   And sang a song for Ireland
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Talking all the day
   <br/>
   With true friends who try to make you stay
   <br/>
   Telling jokes and news
   <br/>
   Singing songs to pass the night away
   <br/>
   Watched the Galway salmon run
   <br/>
   Like silver dancing, darting in the sun
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Drinking all the day
   <br/>
   In old pubs where fiddlers love to play
   <br/>
   Someone touched the bow
   <br/>
   He played a reel, it seemed so grand and gay
   <br/>
   Stood on Dingle beach and cast
   <br/>
   In wild foam we found Atlantic bass
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Dreaming in the night
   <br/>
   I saw a land where no man had to fight
   <br/>
   Waking in your dawn
   <br/>
   I saw you crying in the morning light
   <br/>
   Lying where the falcons fly
   <br/>
   They twist and turn all in your e'er blue sky
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
