   </b>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   City walls where the neon spits as it falls
   <br/>
   Two dark shadows fade in the night
   <br/>
   This is no place for love
   <br/>
   And in the park where the streetlight kisses the dark
   <br/>
   Silent waves and times their own
   <br/>
   They'll have their own way now
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   In the nightime neon sunset leaps
   <br/>
   Out of the heart of the city streets
   <br/>
   To the pavement where the dancing girls go down
   <br/>
   To another world where the bright lights always shine
   <br/>
   From the pale love and the painted face
   <br/>
   Cheap disguises of another race
   <br/>
   Where the sweet life and the flowing wine
   <br/>
   Makes me light in my head and takes the trouble off my mind
   <br/>
   But I know that goes so far
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   We could be like lovers, too
   <br/>
   Dancing in this frozen room
   <br/>
   Hold me, hold me, stand so close
   <br/>
   Take the time, don't leave
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Don't leave me here, there's danger
   <br/>
   I heard the voices in the night
   <br/>
   Flashing in the hills
   <br/>
   The smell of burning on the wind
   <br/>
   We could be in danger
   <br/>
   From the strangers here inside
   <br/>
   From the glory in their lives
   <br/>
   And the passion in their eyes
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   In the nightime neon sunset leaps
   <br/>
   Out of the heart of the city streets
   <br/>
   To the pavement where the dancing girls go down
   <br/>
   To another world where the bright lights always shine
   <br/>
   From the pale love and the painted face
   <br/>
   Cheap disguises of another race
   <br/>
   Where the sweet life and the flowing wine
   <br/>
   Makes me light in my head and takes the trouble off my mind
   <br/>
   But I know that goes so far
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus 3x)
  </p>
