  <p align="center">
   The sheep's in the meadow, the cow's in the corn
   <br/>
   Now is the time for a child to be born
   <br/>
   You'll laugh at the moon and you'll cry for the sun
   <br/>
   And if it's a boy, he'll carry a gun
   <br/>
   Sang the crow on the cradle
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And if it should be that this baby's a girl
   <br/>
   Never you mind if her hair doesn't curl
   <br/>
   With rings on her fingers, bells on her toes
   <br/>
   A shadow above her wherever she goes
   <br/>
   Sang the crow on the cradle
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The crow on the cradle, the black on the white
   <br/>
   Somebody's baby is born for a fight
   <br/>
   The crow on the cradle, the white on the black
   <br/>
   Somebody's baby is not coming back
   <br/>
   Sang the crow on the cradle
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Bring me my gun and I'll shoot that bird dead
   <br/>
   That's what your mother and father once said
   <br/>
   A crow on the cradle, what can we do?
   <br/>
   This is the thing I must leave up to you
   <br/>
   Sang the crow on the cradle
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Sang the crow on the cradle
  </p>
