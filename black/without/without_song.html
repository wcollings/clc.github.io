  <p align="center">
   I know it's the same old song I'm singing
   <br/>
   But this time these words are just for you
   <br/>
   That's the only thing that's new
   <br/>
   I know that I've sung about a million
   <br/>
   Borrowed lines and phrases from a few
   <br/>
   This one's still as good as new
   <br/>
   Without the fanfare I love you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   By day I move words around like flowers
   <br/>
   I deliver by the afternoon
   <br/>
   'Cause the piper calls the tune
   <br/>
   Today I made full use of the hours
   <br/>
   I explored the smallest avenue
   <br/>
   And that feeling still came through
   <br/>
   Without the fanfare I love you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Sure, I've lost my way sometimes
   <br/>
   But I've had to pay
   <br/>
   Sometimes I've gone completely overboard
   <br/>
   Moved a million phrases 'round
   <br/>
   Tried to make them leave the ground
   <br/>
   Still the only line that's soared
   <br/>
   Bidding all the rest adieu
   <br/>
   Sounding still as good as new
   <br/>
   Without the fanfare I love you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Hello, do I still have your attention?
   <br/>
   I forgot to mention thanks again
   <br/>
   From the captain and the crew
   <br/>
   And so without the sweet perfume or roses
   <br/>
   I hope you can still believe it's true
   <br/>
   Stripped of all that much ado
   <br/>
   Without the fanfare I love you
   <br/>
   Without the fanfare I love you
  </p>
