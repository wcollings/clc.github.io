  <p align="center">
   The water is wide, I can't cross o'er
   <br/>
   And neither have I wings to fly
   <br/>
   Give me a boat that can carry two
   <br/>
   And we shall row, my love and I
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   For love is gentle and love is kind
   <br/>
   The sweetest flower when first it's new
   <br/>
   But love grows old and waxes cold
   <br/>
   And fades away like morning dew
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There is a ship, and she sails the sea
   <br/>
   She's loaded deep as deep can be
   <br/>
   But not as deep as the love I'm in
   <br/>
   I know not how I sink or swim
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   For love is gentle, and love is kind
   <br/>
   The sweetest flower when first it's new
   <br/>
   But love grows old and waxes cold
   <br/>
   And fades away like morning dew
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The water is wide, I can't cross o'er
   <br/>
   And neither have I wings to fly
   <br/>
   Give me a boat that can carry two
   <br/>
   And we shall row, my love and I
  </p>
