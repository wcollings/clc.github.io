  </p>
  <p align="center">
   From the corner of my eye I see a tear rollin' down
   <br/>
   At the time I couldn't tell whose tear it was
   <br/>
   If it was mine I should be glad that I still function in this cage
   <br/>
   But if it's yours, it only makes me more lost
   <br/>
   To see a tear rolling down
   <br/>
   To see a tear rolling down
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   This is the last call for Ellis Island
   <br/>
   These are the last words I'm ever gonna hear you say
   <br/>
   So good-bye, babe, good-bye, babe
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I hear sweethearts whisper their undying love
   <br/>
   Above the noise on the quay their voices rise
   <br/>
   They must have something so strong in the face of such change
   <br/>
   That they can promise and promise all night
   <br/>
   Oh, their undying love
   <br/>
   Hear their undying love
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh what you wouldn't give
   <br/>
   To be down on the pier once again
   <br/>
   Far away from the cries
   <br/>
   Of this war-weary horde
   <br/>
   Time up there in the clouds
   <br/>
   Must be hard to endure
   <br/>
   When your heart's unsure
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It's like a knife in my gut knowing you're taking leave
   <br/>
   I feel I'm sentenced to a death without appeal
   <br/>
   I can pretend it's all a dream, and what I'm seeing will disappear
   <br/>
   But the end I can see is all too real
   <br/>
   Knowing you're taking leave
   <br/>
   Knowing you're taking leave
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus 2x)
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
