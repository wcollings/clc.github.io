  <p align="center">
   Oh the sky was clear, the morn was fair
   <br/>
   No breath came over the sea
   <br/>
   When Mary left her highland home
   <br/>
   And wandered forth with me
   <br/>
   All the flowers decked the mountainside
   <br/>
   And fragrance filled the vale
   <br/>
   By far the sweetest flower there
   <br/>
   Was the rose of Allendale
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Sweet rose of Allendale
   <br/>
   Sweet rose of Allendale
   <br/>
   By far the sweetest flower there
   <br/>
   Was the rose of Allendale
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Where e'er I wandered to the east and to the west
   <br/>
   And faith began to lower
   <br/>
   Consoling still was she to me
   <br/>
   In sorrow's lonely hour
   <br/>
   Oh tempest wrecked my lonely boat
   <br/>
   And they wrecked the quivering sails
   <br/>
   One maiden fond withstood the storm
   <br/>
   Was the rose of Allendale
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Sweet rose of Allendale
   <br/>
   Sweet rose of Allendale
   <br/>
   One maiden fond withstood the storm
   <br/>
   Was the rose of Allendale
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And when my feeble lips were parched
   <br/>
   On Africa's burning sands
   <br/>
   She whispered hopes of happiness
   <br/>
   And tales of foreign lands
   <br/>
   My life has been a wilderness
   <br/>
   Unblessed by fortune's gain
   <br/>
   Had fate not linked my love to her
   <br/>
   Sweet rose of Allendale
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Sweet rose of Allendale
   <br/>
   Sweet rose of Allendale
   <br/>
   Had fate not linked my love to her
   <br/>
   Sweet rose of Allendale
  </p>
