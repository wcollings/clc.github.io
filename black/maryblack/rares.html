  <p align="center">
   Last year at Lady Mary's fair when I was in Dundee
   <br/>
   I fell in with an old sweetheart, and he being on a spree
   <br/>
   His company I did accept and with him I did go
   <br/>
   But to my sad misfortune it proved my overthrow
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We wandered east, we wandered west, we wandered through the lawn
   <br/>
   He said he'd see me home that night, but home I never saw
   <br/>
   He kept beside me all the while resolved to have his will
   <br/>
   And by and by we lost our way at the back of Rare's Hill
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And when we got to Rare's Hill, the laddie said to me
   <br/>
   "We can't go home tonight, my dear, it's far too late, you'll see
   <br/>
   But the night is warm and in my pouch, I've got another gill
   <br/>
   So we can lie down here content at the back of Rare's Hill"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   For then he poured a nip a piece to quiet all alarm
   <br/>
   When I awoke in the morning, we were locked in each other's arms
   <br/>
   He handed me the bottle another glass to fill
   <br/>
   And I drank his health in store o' wealth at the back of Rare's Hill
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And then the lad, he said to me, "Oh lassie, do not mourn
   <br/>
   For while I draw the breath of life, from you I'll never turn
   <br/>
   If you will come to yonder town, my wedded wife to be
   <br/>
   We'll be the happiest couple yet 'twas ever in Dundee"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, it's may I never prosper and may I never thrive
   <br/>
   In anything I take in hand as long as I'm alive
   <br/>
   If e'er I say I rue the day my laddie had his will
   <br/>
   Success to Lady Mary's fair and the back of Rare's Hill
  </p>
