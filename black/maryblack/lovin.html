  <p align="center">
   I have been wond'ring what I'm gonna do
   <br/>
   While you are sleeping, am I sleeping too?
   <br/>
   Well, I'm just sittin' here lovin' you
   <br/>
   Close my eyes and lovin' you
   <br/>
   Oh I'm just sittin' back, sittin' here lovin' you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   If you've been wond'ring just what I would do
   <br/>
   If I weren't sleeping had I not found you
   <br/>
   Well, I'd be outside findin' you
   <br/>
   I'd be walkin' down the avenue findin' you
   <br/>
   Oh I'm just sittin' back, sittin' here lovin' you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Oh the reason that you never see me runnin' 'round
   <br/>
   Fingers on my forehead couldn't calm me down
   <br/>
   And I can't even get me up and on my feet
   <br/>
   When I have to take care of some bus'ness on the street
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh I have been walkin' all my streets alone
   <br/>
   I'd keep on walkin' to keep from goin' home
   <br/>
   I couldn't quite barely conceive of you
   <br/>
   Now I can't conceive of ever leavin' you
   <br/>
   Oh I'm just stittin' back, sittin' here lovin' you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   If you've been wond'ring just what I would do
   <br/>
   If I weren't sleeping had I not found you
   <br/>
   Well, I'd be outside findin' you
   <br/>
   I'd be walkin' down the avenue findin' you
   <br/>
   I'm just sittin' back, sittin' here lovin' you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh I'm just sittin' back, sittin' here lovin' you
   <br/>
   Oh I'm just sittin' back, sittin' here lovin' you
  </p>
