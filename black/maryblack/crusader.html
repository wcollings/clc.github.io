  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There's a wilderness, it's a no man's land
   <br/>
   Between Alice Springs and the ocean
   <br/>
   Seventeen hundred miles of burning sand
   <br/>
   And a silken thread keeps a hold on you
   <br/>
   When the emptiness like a potion
   <br/>
   Tends to fray your reason strand by strand
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And there's no more need for the mask you wear
   <br/>
   When the last good-byes have been said
   <br/>
   So kiss the cheeks of your dearest friends
   <br/>
   And turn to the desert ahead
   <br/>
   Now you're on your own like a sailing ship
   <br/>
   You're the captain, the crew and the sailors
   <br/>
   Turn around and this is what you see
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   This is me, facing me
   <br/>
   All alone 'cause I choose to be
   <br/>
   With the wind and the sun on me
   <br/>
   Only me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Now you dream so much about being lost
   <br/>
   Your ghost by a coolebah sleeping
   <br/>
   Haunts you and whispers in your ear
   <br/>
   Give up, give up this lonely road
   <br/>
   No one knows the promise you're keeping
   <br/>
   You can't touch the emptiness out here
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But the grace that mends this broken wing
   <br/>
   The blue sky to regain
   <br/>
   Will lift those feet and raise those eyes
   <br/>
   To face the desert again
   <br/>
   As the dawn reveals the journey's end
   <br/>
   In truth it's only beginning
   <br/>
   And it's as big as your eyes wish to see
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus 2x)
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
 </body>
