<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua"><b><u>Lyrics</u>:</b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
Harking is bonnie, and there lives my love<br>
My heart lies on him and will not remove<br>
It will not remove, oh for all that I have done<br>
Oh I never will forget me love, Anachie<br>
For Anachie Gordon, he's bonnie and he's rough<br>
He'd entice any woman that ever he saw<br>
He'd entice any woman and so he has done me<br>
Oh I never will forget me love, Anachie</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
Down came her father and he's standing by the door<br>
Saying, "Jeannie, you're trying the tricks of a whore<br>
You care nothing for a man who cares so very much for thee<br>
You must marry Lord Sulton and leave Anachie<br>
For Anachie Gordon, he's barely but a man<br>
Although he may be pretty, but where are his lands?<br>
Oh the Sulton's lands are broad, and his towers they run high<br>
You must marry Lord Sulton and leave Anachie"</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
With Anachie Gordon I'd beg for my bread<br>
And before I'll marry Sulton, it's gold to my head<br>
With gold to my head and gowns fringed to the knee<br>
And I'll die if I don't get me love, Anachie<br>
And you, that are my parents, to church you may me bring<br>
But unto Lord Sulton I'll never bear a son<br>
To a son or a daughter, I'll never bow my knee<br>
And I'll die if I don't get me love, Anachie</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
Jeannie was married and from church she was brought home<br>
And when she and her maidens so merry should have been<br>
When she and her maidens so merry should have been<br>
She went into her chamber, she cries all alone</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
Come to bed now, Jeannie, me honey and my sweet<br>
For to style you my mistress, it would be so sweet<br>
Be it mistress or Jeannie, it's all the same to me<br>
But in your bed, Lord Sulton, I never will lie<br>
And down came her father, and he's spoken with reknown<br>
Saying, "You, that are her maidens, go loosen off her gowns"<br>
But she fell down to the floor so close down by his knee<br>
Saying, "Father, look, I'm dying for me love, Anachie"</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
The day that Jeannie married was the day that Jeannie died<br>
And the day that young Anachie came home on the tide<br>
And down came her maidens all wringing of their hands<br>
Saying, "Oh it's been so long, you've spent so long on the sands<br>
Oh so long on the sands, so long on the flood<br>
They have married your Jeannie, and now she lies dead"</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
You, that are her maidens, go take me by the hand<br>
And take me to the chamber that me love, she lies in<br>
And he's kissed her cold lips 'til his heart has turned to stone<br>
And he's died in the chamber that his love, she lies in</font></p></body>
