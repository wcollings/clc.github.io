  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Harking is bonnie, and there lives my love
   <br/>
   My heart lies on him and will not remove
   <br/>
   It will not remove, oh for all that I have done
   <br/>
   Oh I never will forget me love, Anachie
   <br/>
   For Anachie Gordon, he's bonnie and he's rough
   <br/>
   He'd entice any woman that ever he saw
   <br/>
   He'd entice any woman and so he has done me
   <br/>
   Oh I never will forget me love, Anachie
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Down came her father and he's standing by the door
   <br/>
   Saying, "Jeannie, you're trying the tricks of a whore
   <br/>
   You care nothing for a man who cares so very much for thee
   <br/>
   You must marry Lord Sulton and leave Anachie
   <br/>
   For Anachie Gordon, he's barely but a man
   <br/>
   Although he may be pretty, but where are his lands?
   <br/>
   Oh the Sulton's lands are broad, and his towers they run high
   <br/>
   You must marry Lord Sulton and leave Anachie"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   With Anachie Gordon I'd beg for my bread
   <br/>
   And before I'll marry Sulton, it's gold to my head
   <br/>
   With gold to my head and gowns fringed to the knee
   <br/>
   And I'll die if I don't get me love, Anachie
   <br/>
   And you, that are my parents, to church you may me bring
   <br/>
   But unto Lord Sulton I'll never bear a son
   <br/>
   To a son or a daughter, I'll never bow my knee
   <br/>
   And I'll die if I don't get me love, Anachie
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Jeannie was married and from church she was brought home
   <br/>
   And when she and her maidens so merry should have been
   <br/>
   When she and her maidens so merry should have been
   <br/>
   She went into her chamber, she cries all alone
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Come to bed now, Jeannie, me honey and my sweet
   <br/>
   For to style you my mistress, it would be so sweet
   <br/>
   Be it mistress or Jeannie, it's all the same to me
   <br/>
   But in your bed, Lord Sulton, I never will lie
   <br/>
   And down came her father, and he's spoken with reknown
   <br/>
   Saying, "You, that are her maidens, go loosen off her gowns"
   <br/>
   But she fell down to the floor so close down by his knee
   <br/>
   Saying, "Father, look, I'm dying for me love, Anachie"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The day that Jeannie married was the day that Jeannie died
   <br/>
   And the day that young Anachie came home on the tide
   <br/>
   And down came her maidens all wringing of their hands
   <br/>
   Saying, "Oh it's been so long, you've spent so long on the sands
   <br/>
   Oh so long on the sands, so long on the flood
   <br/>
   They have married your Jeannie, and now she lies dead"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You, that are her maidens, go take me by the hand
   <br/>
   And take me to the chamber that me love, she lies in
   <br/>
   And he's kissed her cold lips 'til his heart has turned to stone
   <br/>
   And he's died in the chamber that his love, she lies in
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
