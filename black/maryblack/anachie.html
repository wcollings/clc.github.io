    Harking is bonnie, and there lives my love
    <br/>
    My heart lies on him and will not remove
    <br/>
    It will not remove, oh for all that I have done
    <br/>
    Oh I never will forget me love, Anachie
    <br/>
    For Anachie Gordon, he's bonnie and he's rough
    <br/>
    He'd entice any woman that ever he saw
    <br/>
    He'd entice any woman and so he has done me
    <br/>
    Oh I never will forget me love, Anachie
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    Down came her father and he's standing by the door
    <br/>
    Saying, "Jeannie, you're trying the tricks of a whore
    <br/>
    You care nothing for a man who cares so very much for thee
    <br/>
    You must marry Lord Sulton and leave Anachie
    <br/>
    For Anachie Gordon, he's barely but a man
    <br/>
    Although he may be pretty, but where are his lands?
    <br/>
    Oh the Sulton's lands are broad, and his towers they run high
    <br/>
    You must marry Lord Sulton and leave Anachie"
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    With Anachie Gordon I'd beg for my bread
    <br/>
    And before I'll marry Sulton, it's gold to my head
    <br/>
    With gold to my head and gowns fringed to the knee
    <br/>
    And I'll die if I don't get me love, Anachie
    <br/>
    And you, that are my parents, to church you may me bring
    <br/>
    But unto Lord Sulton I'll never bear a son
    <br/>
    To a son or a daughter, I'll never bow my knee
    <br/>
    And I'll die if I don't get me love, Anachie
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    Jeannie was married and from church she was brought home
    <br/>
    And when she and her maidens so merry should have been
    <br/>
    When she and her maidens so merry should have been
    <br/>
    She went into her chamber, she cries all alone
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    Come to bed now, Jeannie, me honey and my sweet
    <br/>
    For to style you my mistress, it would be so sweet
    <br/>
    Be it mistress or Jeannie, it's all the same to me
    <br/>
    But in your bed, Lord Sulton, I never will lie
    <br/>
    And down came her father, and he's spoken with reknown
    <br/>
    Saying, "You, that are her maidens, go loosen off her gowns"
    <br/>
    But she fell down to the floor so close down by his knee
    <br/>
    Saying, "Father, look, I'm dying for me love, Anachie"
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    The day that Jeannie married was the day that Jeannie died
    <br/>
    And the day that young Anachie came home on the tide
    <br/>
    And down came her maidens all wringing of their hands
    <br/>
    Saying, "Oh it's been so long, you've spent so long on the sands
    <br/>
    Oh so long on the sands, so long on the flood
    <br/>
    They have married your Jeannie, and now she lies dead"
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    You, that are her maidens, go take me by the hand
    <br/>
    And take me to the chamber that me love, she lies in
    <br/>
    And he's kissed her cold lips 'til his heart has turned to stone
    <br/>
    And he's died in the chamber that his love, she lies in
   </font>
