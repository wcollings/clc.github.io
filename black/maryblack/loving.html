   I went to church on Sunday, my love, she passed me by
   <br/>
   I knew her mind was changing by the roving of her eye
   <br/>
   By the roving of her eye, by the roving of her eye
   <br/>
   I knew her mind was changing by the roving of her eye
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   My love is fair and proper, her waist is neat and small
   <br/>
   And she is quite good looking, and that's the best of all
   <br/>
   And that's the best of all, and that's the best of all
   <br/>
   And she is quite good looking, and that's the best of all
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh Hannah, loving Hannah, come give to me your hand
   <br/>
   You said if you would marry that I would be the one
   <br/>
   That I would be the one, that I would be the one
   <br/>
   You said if you would marry, that I would be the one
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I will go down by the river when everyone's asleep
   <br/>
   I'll think of loving Hannah and then sit down and weep
   <br/>
   And then sit down and weep, and then sit down and weep
   <br/>
   I'll think of loving Hannah and then sit down and weep
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I went to church on Sunday, my love, she passed me by
   <br/>
   I knew her mind was changing by the roving of her eye
   <br/>
   By the roving of her eye, by the roving of her eye
   <br/>
   I knew her mind was changing by the roving of her eye
  </p>
