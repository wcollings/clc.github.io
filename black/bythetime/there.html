   There is a time in life it seems
   <br/>
   For believing in dreams
   <br/>
   For me it's gone
   <br/>
   And though I realize today
   <br/>
   Dreams are empty anyway
   <br/>
   I still feel wronged
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I felt cheated when you went away
   <br/>
   But not as defeated as I felt the day
   <br/>
   You came back and we found so little to say
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There is a time in life I know
   <br/>
   When we all must outgrow
   <br/>
   Young ideals
   <br/>
   And the wisdom that we gain
   <br/>
   Is paid for with the pain
   <br/>
   I now feel
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I felt cheated when you went away
   <br/>
   But not as defeated as I felt the day
   <br/>
   You came back and we found so little to say
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There is a time in life it seems
   <br/>
   For believing in dreams
   <br/>
   For me it's gone
  </p>
  <cleaned>
