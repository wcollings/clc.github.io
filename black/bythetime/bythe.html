  <p align="center">
   Baby, every cloud has a silver lining
   <br/>
   Baby, every dog really has his day
   <br/>
   And it matters to me to see you smiling
   <br/>
   Why don't we blow all your cares away?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Yesterday is gone and will be forgotten
   <br/>
   And today is where every new day starts
   <br/>
   Got to be free as the leaves in the autumn
   <br/>
   You may be sad, but it will never last
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Maybe by the evening we'll be laughing
   <br/>
   Just wait and see all the changes there'll be
   <br/>
   By the time it gets dark
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We could go walking out in the sunshine
   <br/>
   Look at all the people out in the street
   <br/>
   Hurrying away to a business luncheon
   <br/>
   Waiting for a taxi for aching feet
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Light up your face, baby, let's get going
   <br/>
   Want to see a change in those weary eyes
   <br/>
   We'll have some fun, take a boat out rowing
   <br/>
   Why on earth should life be so serious?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Maybe by the evening we'll be laughing
   <br/>
   Just you wait and see all the changes there'll be
   <br/>
   By the time it gets dark
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Maybe by the evening we'll be laughing
   <br/>
   Just wait and see all the changes there'll be
   <br/>
   By the time it gets dark
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   By the time it gets dark
   <br/>
   By the time it gets dark
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
