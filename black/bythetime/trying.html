  <p align="center">
   We don't always live in harmony
   <br/>
   And often there are times when we are enemies
   <br/>
   I fight with you, and you fight with me
   <br/>
   Trying to get the balance right
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Sometimes we cause each other pain
   <br/>
   Sometimes our wills are not the same
   <br/>
   And often we tire of the strain
   <br/>
   Trying to get the balance right
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Like a circus pair
   <br/>
   High up in the air
   <br/>
   Working on their act
   <br/>
   We need that kind of pact
   <br/>
   High above the ring
   <br/>
   Watch them balancing
   <br/>
   See how they unite
   <br/>
   We, too, can get it right
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We don't always seem to get along
   <br/>
   And one of us often acts too strong
   <br/>
   Sometimes we find we're goin' wrong
   <br/>
   Trying to get the balance right
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We don't always live in harmony
   <br/>
   And often there are times when we are enemies
   <br/>
   But I love you, and you love me
   <br/>
   When we get the balance right
   <br/>
   When we get the balance right
   <br/>
   We can get the balance right
  </p>
