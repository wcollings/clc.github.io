     Lyrics

  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I cannot stop this child from touching me
   <br/>
   I see no fault in watching her bloom
   <br/>
   She knows where fire begins and where sparks might fly
   <br/>
   Yet I feel she may be consumed
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She done turns on the B stage
   <br/>
   She shook hands when the shoe fit
   <br/>
   I wanna know how the land lies
   <br/>
   I'll let you in on a secret
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I did not steal away when love rode by
   <br/>
   I did not let myself be unkind
   <br/>
   It's so hard to say where love meets lust
   <br/>
   I often think I'm losing my mind
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I trade notes with the press league
   <br/>
   They send back their suggestions
   <br/>
   I wanna know where I come from
   <br/>
   But all I get are directions
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   I can't get started, I can't get going, what's wrong?
   <br/>
   Big ideas, the fine intentions, they're all gone
   <br/>
   It takes two flagons of courage, pounds, shillings and pence
   <br/>
   You wind up going nowhere, it doesn't make sense
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I see my brother's face grow dark with care
   <br/>
   I spend my time avoiding his gaze
   <br/>
   I pray that God might make his dreams come true
   <br/>
   I'd give so much to feel he's been saved
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   A bright spark in the playground
   <br/>
   Dead loss as an anchor
   <br/>
   You don't call him a misfit
   <br/>
   He's just stuck for an answer
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I can't get started, I can't get going, what's wrong?
   <br/>
   Big ideas, the fine intentions, they're all gone
   <br/>
   I can't get started, I can't get going, what's wrong?
   <br/>
   I can't get started, I can't get going, what's wrong?
  </p>
