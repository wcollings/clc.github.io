  <p align="center">
   First when I came to the town
   <br/>
   They called me young and bonny
   <br/>
   Now they've changed my name
   <br/>
   Called me the Leaboy's honey
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I'll dye my petticoats red
   <br/>
   And I'll face them with a yellow
   <br/>
   I'll tell the dyester lads
   <br/>
   That the Leaboys I've to follow
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It's over hills and dales
   <br/>
   And over dykes and ditches
   <br/>
   Say, will I like the lad
   <br/>
   That wears the moleskin breeches?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The black horse draws the cart
   <br/>
   And he's as proud as any
   <br/>
   Say, will I like the lad
   <br/>
   That drives him on so canny?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Feather beds are fine
   <br/>
   Painted rooms are bonny
   <br/>
   But I would leave them all
   <br/>
   To jog away with Johnny
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh for Saturday night
   <br/>
   It's I that'll see my dearie
   <br/>
   He'll come whistlin' in
   <br/>
   When I am tired and weary
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   First when I came to the town
   <br/>
   They called me proud and saucy
   <br/>
   Now they've changed my name
   <br/>
   Called me the Leaboy's lassie
  </p>
