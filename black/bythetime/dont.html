   Hush now, don't explain
   <br/>
   You're my joy and pain
   <br/>
   Skip that lipstick, don't explain
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Hush now, don't explain
   <br/>
   My loss will be your gain
   <br/>
   You're back, and I'm glad, don't explain
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You know that I love you
   <br/>
   And what love'll do
   <br/>
   Place no one above you
   <br/>
   I'm so completely yours
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Cry to hear folks chatter
   <br/>
   And I know you cheat
   <br/>
   Right or wrong don't matter
   <br/>
   When you're with me, sweet
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You know that I love you
   <br/>
   And what love'll do
