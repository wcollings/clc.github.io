  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It's time to go, Jenny, no need to close the door
   <br/>
   What if the dust gets in the house? It doesn't matter any more
   <br/>
   You and the dust have been at war for far too many years
   <br/>
   But now the war is over, Jenny dear
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Leaving the land
   <br/>
   Leaving the land
   <br/>
   Leaving all I've ever been and everything I am
   <br/>
   Leaving the land
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Remember when I brought you here those long, bright years ago?
   <br/>
   For all that time you've been my heart, and this land has been my soul
   <br/>
   The long, bright days are over now, but still the heart beats on
   <br/>
   But, Jenny dear, the soul is gone
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It's time to go, Jenny, drive quickly down the track
   <br/>
   We'll never see what lies ahead if we keep on looking back
   <br/>
   Behind is just an empty house, old memories and ghosts
   <br/>
   And our small dream gathering dust
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Leaving the land
  </p>
 </body>
