   Schoolday's over, come on, then, John
   <br/>
   Time to be getting your pit boots on
   <br/>
   On with your sack and your moleskin trousers
   <br/>
   Time you were on your way
   <br/>
   Time you were learning the pitman's job
   <br/>
   And earning a pitman's pay
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Come on, then, Jim, it's time to go
   <br/>
   Time you were working down below
   <br/>
   Time to be handling a pick and shovel
   <br/>
   You start at the pits today
   <br/>
   Time to be learning the collier's job
   <br/>
   And earning a collier's pay
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Come on, then, Dai, it's nearly light
   <br/>
   Time you were off to the anthracite
   <br/>
   The morning mist is on the valley
   <br/>
   It's time you were on your way
   <br/>
   Time you were learning the miner's job
   <br/>
   And earning a miner's pay
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Schoolday's over, come on, then, John
   <br/>
   Time to be getting your pit boots on
   <br/>
   On with your sack and your moleskin trousers
   <br/>
   Time you were on your way
   <br/>
   Time you were learning the pitman's job
   <br/>
   And earning a pitman's pay
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Come on, then, John
