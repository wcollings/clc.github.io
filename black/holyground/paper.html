  <p align="center">
   They sent you down a paper friend, I hear
   <br/>
   You went back on all the vows you once held dear
   <br/>
   There you stretched so calm and quiet
   <br/>
   And things looked good, now don't deny it
   <br/>
   You walked on air for fifteen minutes
   <br/>
   And after that there was nothing in it
   <br/>
   You don't need those paper friends at all
   <br/>
   No, you don't need those kind of friends
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You say you've lost your sense of time again
   <br/>
   Well, you've been using that excuse since who knows when
   <br/>
   You went the way of all young rebels
   <br/>
   Ignore the gods, embrace the devils
   <br/>
   But they're no good for you in your state
   <br/>
   So why not drive them right out of your gates?
   <br/>
   'Cause you don't need those paper friends at all
   <br/>
   You don't need those type of friends
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   No one knows what you're feeling
   <br/>
   And life goes on in its own sweet time
   <br/>
   Your passions flame for no reason
   <br/>
   You haunt the city for something that shines
   <br/>
   Even one thing to rhyme
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And if I meet you on the rounds today
   <br/>
   I hope you won't turn on your heel or walk away
   <br/>
   Yes, I know it takes so much effort
   <br/>
   But facing up can be so much better
   <br/>
   So what if dreams, they all come to nothing?
   <br/>
   Just blow your nose and keep on looking
   <br/>
   'Cause you don't need those paper friends at all
   <br/>
   You don't need those kind of friends
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You don't need those paper friends at all
   <br/>
   You don't need those paper friends
  </p>
