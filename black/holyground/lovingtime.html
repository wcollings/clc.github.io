  <p align="center">
   It reads like a fairytale, and that's what it was
   <br/>
   Young man in his prime, young girl from the cross
   <br/>
   The most perfect of strangers, and then the night closed in
   <br/>
   And the holy ground took care of everything
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Now she was a fine one, and he was a handsome man
   <br/>
   One look was enough, and away they ran
   <br/>
   They spent many happy hours and then the night closed in
   <br/>
   And the holy ground took care of everything
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh what's the use in complaining?
   <br/>
   In for a penny, in for a pound
   <br/>
   I remember the loving time
   <br/>
   And nothing else really counts
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And I recall the promise they made
   <br/>
   With a faith I can but admire
   <br/>
   That she'd be the one he adored
   <br/>
   And he'd be her heart's desire
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It didn't come true in the end, they went their separate ways
   <br/>
   He couldn't change what he was, she wasn't ready to wait
   <br/>
   They couldn't live in the daylight, they let the night close in
   <br/>
   And the holy ground took care of everything
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   They couldn't live in the daylight, they let the night close in
   <br/>
   And the holy ground took care of everything
   <br/>
   They couldn't live in the daylight, they let the night close in
   <br/>
   And the holy ground took care of everything
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I remember the loving time
   <br/>
   And nothing else really counts
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
