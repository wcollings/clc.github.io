   If we leave here today
   <br/>
   We could be a thousand miles away
   <br/>
   Take to that road, see how far it goes
   <br/>
   And on that great ocean road
   <br/>
   Oh the country's in our bones
   <br/>
   All the trouble that you know
   <br/>
   Empties out as you go
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh walk with me, talk with me
   <br/>
   Tell me your stories
   <br/>
   I'll do my best to understand you
   <br/>
   You're flesh and blood, flesh and blood
   <br/>
   Don't refuse me your love
   <br/>
   More than words can express
   <br/>
   More than wealth or success
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh there's a thousand things to do
   <br/>
   So let's start here with me and you
   <br/>
   All the pain that you feel
   <br/>
   All the hurt that seems so real
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh come on, walk with me, talk with me
   <br/>
   Tell me your stories
   <br/>
   I'll do my very best to understand you
   <br/>
   You're flesh and blood
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You can't go on holding back the flooding river
   <br/>
   Keeping all that fear inside
   <br/>
   I understand how trouble haunts you
   <br/>
   It haunts me, too
   <br/>
   Yes, and I do know how you feel
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh there's a thousand things to do
   <br/>
   So let's start here with me and you
   <br/>
   Gonna take a little time
   <br/>
   Let's see what we can find
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh come on, walk with me, talk with me
   <br/>
   Tell me your stories
   <br/>
   I'll do my best to understand you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh won't you walk with me, talk with me
   <br/>
   Tell me your stories
   <br/>
   I'll do my very best to understand you
   <br/>
   You're flesh and blood, flesh and blood
   <br/>
   You're flesh and blood
  </p>
