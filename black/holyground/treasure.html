  <p align="center">
   Oh love is never easy
   <br/>
   It's almost always out of your way
   <br/>
   It's not the path of least resistance
   <br/>
   It's not some words you get to say
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It's a stream running up a mountain
   <br/>
   It's a wave rolling out from the shore
   <br/>
   Wish I could say I never felt that way before
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I have a friend who's lonely
   <br/>
   She is chasing after her dreams
   <br/>
   And she is the one and only
   <br/>
   One who knows how hard it could be
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There's a treasure on her island buried in the city of news
   <br/>
   Wish I could say we didn't have that much to lose
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   One friend tried to end it
   <br/>
   He could not see the good in his life
   <br/>
   In his mirror or his pocket
   <br/>
   And his hopes had come down like a knife
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It's a stream running up a mountain
   <br/>
   It's a wave rolling out from the shore
   <br/>
   Wish I could say I never felt that way before
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There's a treasure on these islands buried in the city of news
   <br/>
   Wish I could say we didn't have that much to lose
   <br/>
   Oh there's a treasure on these islands buried in the city of news
   <br/>
   Wish I could say we didn't have that much to lose
  </p>
