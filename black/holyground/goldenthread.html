   I looked into a mirror made of lines
   <br/>
   With tiny symbols here and there to make the image mine
   <br/>
   A woman stood and painted and showed me what to find
   <br/>
   The different parts, the fire, the air, and where my life would climb
   <br/>
   And where it joins another, and what would always bind
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   It's a golden thread to hold you all of my days
   <br/>
   Hold my head against you now and for always
   <br/>
   Sewn me up, shown us a long, long time
   <br/>
   Makes you my life, makes you my life
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The moving finger writes and goes away
   <br/>
   I'm weighed upon a balance here and I'm told that I can stay
   <br/>
   The kettle heats, the water speaks up, says I'm not alone
   <br/>
   My whole life is a tapestry and hanging in my home
   <br/>
   And here it joins another by what will always bind
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And when you looked, your angel flew away
   <br/>
   And what it meant was your protection's gone another day
   <br/>
   And what has come to change you, and have you come what may
   <br/>
   Is fashioned by an old triangle, green as April haze
   <br/>
   Blue is just a color, but blue is here to stay
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It's a golden thread to hold you all of my days
   <br/>
   Hold my head against you now and for always
   <br/>
   Sewn me up, shown us a long, long time
   <br/>
   Makes you my life
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Makes you my life
  </p>
