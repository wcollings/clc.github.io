  <p align="center">
   Farewell my lovely Johnny, a thousand times adieu
   <br/>
   You are going away from the holy ground and the ones that love you true
   <br/>
   You will sail the salt seas over and then return for sure
   <br/>
   To see again the ones you love and the holy ground once more
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You're on the salt sea sailing, and I am safe behind
   <br/>
   Fond letters I will write to you, the secrets of my mind
   <br/>
   And the secrets of my mind, my love, you're the one that I adore
   <br/>
   Still I live in hopes you'll see the holy ground once more
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I see the storm a-rising, and it's coming quick and soon
   <br/>
   And the night's so dark and cloudy you can scarcely see the moon
   <br/>
   And the secrets of my mind, my love, you're the one that I adore
   <br/>
   And still I live in hopes you'll see the holy ground once more
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But now the storms are over, and you are safe and well
   <br/>
   We will go into a public house and we'll sit and drink our fill
   <br/>
   We will drink strong ale and porter and we'll make the rafters roar
   <br/>
   And when our money, it is all spent, you'll go to sea once more
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   You're the one that I adore
   <br/>
   And still I live in hopes that you'll see the holy ground once more
  </p>
 </body>
