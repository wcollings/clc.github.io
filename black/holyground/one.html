  <p align="center">
   There you may stand in your splendor and jewels
   <br/>
   Swaying me in both directions
   <br/>
   One is the right one, the other for fools
   <br/>
   How do I make my selection?
   <br/>
   The city lies silent in the warm morning light
   <br/>
   The sand is as golden as saffron
   <br/>
   Oasis of love, sweet water of life
   <br/>
   God bless the poor ones who have none though they have tried
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Someone is drowning down there in the flood
   <br/>
   But this river will dry by tomorrow
   <br/>
   Is it ocean or stream, this love in my blood?
   <br/>
   Bringer of joy or of sorrow?
   <br/>
   The end of the journey must soon be in sight
   <br/>
   Birth is the start of the swansong
   <br/>
   Oasis of love, sweet water of life
   <br/>
   God bless the poor ones who want some, but are denied
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   No one is given the map to their dreams
   <br/>
   All we can do is to trace it
   <br/>
   See where we go to, know where we've been
   <br/>
   Build up the courage to face it
   <br/>
   While we fumble in the darkness where once there was light
   <br/>
   Roaming the land of the ancients
   <br/>
   Oasis of love, sweet water of life
   <br/>
   God bless the poor ones whose patience never died
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   While we stumble in blindness where once there was sight
   <br/>
   Searching for trees in the forest
   <br/>
   Oasis of love, sweet water of life
   <br/>
   God bless the poor ones who have none though they have tried
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   God bless the poor ones who want some, but are denied
   <br/>
   God bless the poor ones whose patience never died
   <br/>
   God bless the poor ones on that one-way donkey ride
  </p>
