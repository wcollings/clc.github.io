  <p align="center">
   When the morning comes
   <br/>
   I gaze on you with desire
   <br/>
   When the morning comes
   <br/>
   My look will be perfectly plain
   <br/>
   When the morning comes
   <br/>
   My beloved one
   <br/>
   When the morning comes
   <br/>
   You'll know that we both feel the same
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   In the afternoon
   <br/>
   Misgivings will pale into nothing
   <br/>
   In the afternoon
   <br/>
   We'll know what it is to believe
   <br/>
   When it's afternoon
   <br/>
   And I covet you
   <br/>
   In the afternoon
   <br/>
   I'll give you no reason to leave
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Done with time and patience I moved with the crowd
   <br/>
   Lonely in my silence and being without
   <br/>
   Then all in one instant straight out of the blue
   <br/>
   Out of all its goodness the summer sent you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Now it's evening time
   <br/>
   And I reach for you lying beside me
   <br/>
   Now it's evening time
   <br/>
   Your kiss will be tender and sure
   <br/>
   Now it's evening time
   <br/>
   Just like every time
   <br/>
   In the evening time
   <br/>
   I love you as much as before
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Done with time and patience I moved with the crowd
   <br/>
   Lonely in my silence and being without
   <br/>
   Then all in one instant straight out of the blue
   <br/>
   Out of all its goodness the summer sent you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   All in one sweet instant straight out of the blue
   <br/>
   Out of all its goodness the summer sent you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The summer sent you
   <br/>
   The summer sent you
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
