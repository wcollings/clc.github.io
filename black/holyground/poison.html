  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I remember when we were sweethearts
   <br/>
   I was safe with you, you were my protector
   <br/>
   Those days are over, now I need someone
   <br/>
   Someone to keep me safe from you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Love was all we had, we were young and sure
   <br/>
   Who'd expect their love would turn to war?
   <br/>
   I don't know who to pity more
   <br/>
   How much pain can love endure?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I should leave you but I can't seem to
   <br/>
   You say, "I'm sorry, dear," and I believe you
   <br/>
   Though the next time may be the worst yet
   <br/>
   How easily I forgive, how quickly you forget
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The poison words, the ugliness
   <br/>
   When low on hope and deep in debt
   <br/>
   The promises that bring regret
   <br/>
   For loving you, is this all I get?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The poison words, the ugliness
   <br/>
   The cold remains of married bliss
   <br/>
   To all our dreams, a fatal kiss
   <br/>
   Oh what kind of love is this?
  </p>
