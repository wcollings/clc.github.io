  <p align="center">
   Late glow on an early winter evening in Dockland
   <br/>
   With my ship of dreams moving easily across the sound
   <br/>
   Reminiscence is weighing me down with a vengeance
   <br/>
   Tide water so deep I think I'm going to drown
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But in the wink of an eye I am rising above the affliction
   <br/>
   In the wink of an eye I am come back in from the cold
   <br/>
   I don't even have to try and I'm gone out of here without notice
   <br/>
   Gone out of Dockland without a care in the world
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It didn't hit me when I met you coming out of the shambles
   <br/>
   It didn't hit me when you took me to the summer field
   <br/>
   I didn't flinch when you told me that you'd get what you wanted
   <br/>
   I never had what it takes to have a heart of steel
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But in the wink of an eye I am rising above the affliction
   <br/>
   In the wink of an eye I am come back in from the cold
   <br/>
   I didn't even have to try and I'm gone out of here without notice
   <br/>
   I'm gone out Dockland without a care in the world
   <br/>
   Gone out of Dockland
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Yes, I loved you the time that is was
   <br/>
   And yes, you may rip me whenever you want
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So it goes on a crystal-clear morning in Dockland
   <br/>
   And heaven knows if I'll ever live to love again
   <br/>
   Struck down by the kiss of an angel in limbo
   <br/>
   Laid low by the act of the going
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But in the wink of an eye I am rising above the affliction
   <br/>
   In the wink of an eye I am come back in from the cold
   <br/>
   I don't even have to try and I'm gone out of here without notice
   <br/>
   Gone out of Dockland without a care in the world
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I'm gone out of Dockland without a care in world
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
