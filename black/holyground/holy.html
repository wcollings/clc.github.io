  <p align="center">
   I was born on the holy ground
   <br/>
   A running child in fields of clover
   <br/>
   I was living in the grandeur
   <br/>
   Of my father's land
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   By the side of the swirling sea
   <br/>
   I spent the days of childish wonder
   <br/>
   And the rocks I held in my young hands
   <br/>
   I never felt them slip away
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, the sun shone bright upon the waves
   <br/>
   And the wind blew high as I was leaving
   <br/>
   And I sailed so far away
   <br/>
   Looking for adventure
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But I would not stay where the city streets
   <br/>
   Proclaimed so loudly man's endeavors
   <br/>
   Though music is a pretty thing
   <br/>
   In fine company
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And the wilderness took my breath away
   <br/>
   Under a sun that never falters
   <br/>
   I felt I had to find my way
   <br/>
   Where no one ever goes
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It was in the south that my new home lay
   <br/>
   With a dark-eyed boy and wild horses
   <br/>
   With humming birds and roses there
   <br/>
   In old Mexico
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There the winds of change, they blew so far
   <br/>
   Of liberty and revolution
   <br/>
   And it seemed that each man heard in his breast
   <br/>
   The drumming of a nation
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I was born on the holy ground
   <br/>
   A running child in fields of clover
   <br/>
   I was living in the grandeur
   <br/>
   Of my father's land
  </p>
