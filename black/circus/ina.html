  <p align="center">
   Something about this is precious
   <br/>
   Something about this is sad
   <br/>
   Something about this is better than I've ever had
   <br/>
   Hard and lean
   <br/>
   You know what I mean?
   <br/>
   How do the roots become tangled?
   <br/>
   Why does the spirit grow tired?
   <br/>
   Where is the key to your kingdom? Yes, that's my desire
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There are those who live to count the cost
   <br/>
   And then more who find themselves content
   <br/>
   I see heaven wrapped up in a box
   <br/>
   It is you come back to love again
   <br/>
   In a dream
   <br/>
   This living dream
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Up in a heap I'm not bothered
   <br/>
   Down in the dumps I'm okay
   <br/>
   Here in my heart you're the best road that I'll ever take
   <br/>
   I'm serene
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There are those who live to take the chance
   <br/>
   And then more who find themselves content
   <br/>
   I see heaven mapped out in advance
   <br/>
   It is you, and that's my journey's end
   <br/>
   In a dream
   <br/>
   This living dream
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I'm trying to hang on to the essence
   <br/>
   I'm feeling more faint by the day
   <br/>
   It took such a long time to get it
   <br/>
   I don't want to see it erased
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There are those who live to count the cost
   <br/>
   And then more who find themselves content
   <br/>
   I see heaven wrapped up in a box
   <br/>
   It is you come back to love again
   <br/>
   In a dream
   <br/>
   This living dream
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   This living dream
