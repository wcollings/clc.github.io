   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   With your dark hair in the Donegal breeze
   <br/>
   Bringing me softly and sweetly to the ground
   <br/>
   But there's madness in the sycamore trees
   <br/>
   And there's no salvation to be found
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Right now the only things that my mind ever holds
   <br/>
   Are long, dark silences or screaming that explodes
   <br/>
   Burning, rocking beds with visions of a land
   <br/>
   Long, dark tunnels, questions and calm
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But with you, you know I have no doubts and fear will have no sting
   <br/>
   With your brilliant eyes and your lost and broken wing
   <br/>
   My head upon your shoulder as you take me in your arms
   <br/>
   Continents will crumble, we will find no harm
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, I'll brace myself against the dark, endeavour to go on
   <br/>
   No matter how long it takes and even though I might be wrong
   <br/>
   And I will ask a little favor of whatever god I find
   <br/>
   And I will come back for you, darling, when I find some peace of mind
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Well, I don't know about tomorrow, it'll be here and gone
   <br/>
   I don't know about tonight, it'll just be too long
   <br/>
   Sometimes I think I'm dying and I don't care how
   <br/>
   All I know is that I want you, and I want you here and now
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
