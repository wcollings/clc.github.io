  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Love showed me its riches late last spring
   <br/>
   Took me to its breast and gave me wings
   <br/>
   I truly did believe and still I was deceived
   <br/>
   Love made me its witness one fine spring
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Life seemed dark and beautiful at once
   <br/>
   All mixed upside-down and back to front
   <br/>
   It was hard to know what's what, the light went on and off
   <br/>
   Life was stark and plentiful at once
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Maybe time really does heal wounds
   <br/>
   Maybe love doesn't know
   <br/>
   A mere heartbeat from happiness
   <br/>
   A stone's throw from the soul
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Days lived with a will
   <br/>
   Days as fine as can be
   <br/>
   Days grace on my morning pillow
   <br/>
   Days I'm longing to see
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Sunlight blows the winter one last kiss
   <br/>
   Me, I hold my breath and make my wish
   <br/>
   We live through thick and thin where evil sometimes wins
   <br/>
   Me, I try my best and think of this
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   That maybe time really does heal wounds
   <br/>
   And maybe love doesn't know
   <br/>
   A mere heartbeat from happiness
   <br/>
   A stone's throw from the soul
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus...)
  </p>
