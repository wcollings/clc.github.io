  <p align="center">
   The sky collapsed around us
   <br/>
   You didn't seem to care
   <br/>
   I hailed you through the raindrops
   <br/>
   You weren't even there
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I juggle with the breakfast
   <br/>
   You fret behind the sheets
   <br/>
   I want you to be steadfast
   <br/>
   You want to be released
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Oh my pretty darling
   <br/>
   Where did we go astray?
   <br/>
   Oh my pretty darling
   <br/>
   I thought you'd come to stay
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We're all dollied up for the circus
   <br/>
   Oh isn't it grand?
   <br/>
   We're laughing and jumping and kissing
   <br/>
   We're beating the band
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I've got no more smiles to win you
   <br/>
   No tricks to turn your head
   <br/>
   When love cannot continue
   <br/>
   There's not much to be said
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   It's all cut and thrust at the circus
   <br/>
   And maybe makes three
   <br/>
   You're twisting my words into serpents
   <br/>
   I'm down on my knees
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I thought you'd come to stay
   <br/>
   I thought you'd come to stay
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
