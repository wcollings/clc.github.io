  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Phone calls and taxi rides, somebody's leaving
   <br/>
   Misunderstandings get out of control
   <br/>
   And the right words get left, and the wrong words get spoken
   <br/>
   He's gone, but not your pride
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Not much can help the full heart that's breaking
   <br/>
   Can't find the words and you can't hide the feelings
   <br/>
   And it's down to the bone, to the heart of the matter
   <br/>
   You're free, free as stone
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Look at you now, you're the picture of sorrow
   <br/>
   Head in your hands like a scene from a movie
   <br/>
   And all of the things that seemed so important
   <br/>
   Are leaves and are blowing away
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But nothing can help the full heart that's breaking
   <br/>
   You can't find the words and can't hide the feelings
   <br/>
   And it's down to the bone, to the heart of the matter
   <br/>
   You're free, you're free as stone
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Walk through this town on a cold Sunday morning
   <br/>
   Soldiers in uniforms, guns in their hands
   <br/>
   The world all caught up with barbed-wire fences
   <br/>
   I'm free, I'm free as stone
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh nothing can help the full heart that's breaking
   <br/>
   You won't find the words and you can't hide the feelings
   <br/>
   And it's down to bone, to the heart of the matter
   <br/>
   You're free, free as stone
   <br/>
   You're free, you're free as stone
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
