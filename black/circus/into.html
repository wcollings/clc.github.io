  <p align="center">
   Cast my boat out to the ocean
   <br/>
   And set its sails to the wind
   <br/>
   Gentle breeze blowing into my heart
   <br/>
   I'm alive in this gentle world
   <br/>
   A life carefree, a life carefree
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And in this love that you give me
   <br/>
   You have to share the joy and mystery
   <br/>
   The wonder of your smile
   <br/>
   And the power of your words
   <br/>
   That changes me, that changes me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Sometimes I could fly
   <br/>
   When your heart, it touches mine
   <br/>
   Deep into the blue
   <br/>
   Where my soul is lost, and all because of you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Gave my heart to another love
   <br/>
   Crashing waves of pain came over me
   <br/>
   In my distress you came and rescued me
   <br/>
   Still the storm talked away
   <br/>
   Of life carefree, of life carefree
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Sometimes I could fly
   <br/>
   When your heart, it touches mine
   <br/>
   Deep into the blue
   <br/>
   Where my soul is lost, and all because of you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When I found myself far away from you
   <br/>
   That's when I hear your voice
   <br/>
   Reminding me, calling me, lifting me
   <br/>
   Out into the blue, out into the blue
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Sometimes I could fly
   <br/>
   When your heart, it touches mine
   <br/>
   Deep into the blue
   <br/>
   Where my soul is lost, and all
   <br/>
   Where my soul is lost, and all because of you
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Where my soul is lost, and all because of you
  </p>
