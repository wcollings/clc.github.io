  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I used to think joy was the break between sorrow
   <br/>
   Like peace was the break between wars
   <br/>
   I'm still partly new now, but mostly older
   <br/>
   And I cannot say I'm so sure
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I never trusted happiness as far as I could throw it
   <br/>
   Always preparing for the worst 'cause I would know it
   <br/>
   All of that hammering in the dark
   <br/>
   Like a new Noah working on his ark
   <br/>
   On his ark
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I may look back at today and feel foolish
   <br/>
   My old view was right all along
   <br/>
   I will rush in where no angels are walking
   <br/>
   And fight for the right to be wrong
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   'Cause I never trusted happiness as far as I could throw it
   <br/>
   Always preparing for the worst 'cause I would know it
   <br/>
   All of that hammering in the dark
   <br/>
   Like a new Noah working on his ark
   <br/>
   On his ark
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Between my potential and the deep, blue sea
   <br/>
   There's a rock and a diamond either side of me
   <br/>
   Between our potential and the break of day
   <br/>
   There is nothing at all in our way
   <br/>
   Nothing in our way
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
