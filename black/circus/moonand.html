  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When I was young, I spoke like a child and saw with a child's eyes
   <br/>
   And an open door was to a girl like the stars are to the skies
   <br/>
   It's funny how the world lives up to all your expectations
   <br/>
   With adventures for the stout of heart and the lure of the open spaces
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There's two lanes running down this road and whichever side you're on
   <br/>
   Accounts for where you want to go or what you are running from
   <br/>
   Back when darkness overtook me on a blindman's curve
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I relied upon the moon
   <br/>
   I relied upon the moon
   <br/>
   I relied upon the moon and St. Christopher
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Now I've paid my dues 'cause I have owed them, but I've paid a price sometimes
   <br/>
   For being such a stubborn woman in such stubborn times
   <br/>
   I have run from the arms of lovers, I have run from the eyes of friends
   <br/>
   I have run from the hands of kindness, I have run just because I can
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But now I've grown and I speak like a woman and I see with a woman's eyes
   <br/>
   And an open door is to me now like the saddest of good-byes
   <br/>
   Well, it's too late for turning back, and I pray for the heart and the nerve
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I relied upon the moon
   <br/>
   I relied upon the moon
   <br/>
   I relied upon the moon and St. Christopher
   <br/>
   (2x)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   To be my guide
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
