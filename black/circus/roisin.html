  <p align="center">
   Half the time I don't even hear what the people are saying
   <br/>
   Half the time I'm so far gone not a word gets in
   <br/>
   I'm here, you're there, okay, but I just want to tell you
   <br/>
   Róisín
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Which side of the coin we show is open to debate
   <br/>
   Either way I accept what the wind brings
   <br/>
   I'm here, you're there, okay, but I just want to tell you
   <br/>
   Róisín, Róisín
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Is it the way that I'm too late?
   <br/>
   If there's a chance, you know I'll wait
   <br/>
   Róisín
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Other hands claw, but mine can be gentle
   <br/>
   No bad blood within me
   <br/>
   This is a thing so rare, oh it's great to be near you
   <br/>
   Róisín, Róisín
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   If all is fair in love and war
   <br/>
   Why am I here and you're so far?
   <br/>
   Róisín
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   My heart's beating under a cloud
   <br/>
   I can't get away from you now
   <br/>
   Róisín
   <br/>
   My heart's beating under a cloud
   <br/>
   There's no getting out of it now
   <br/>
   Róisín, Róisín
