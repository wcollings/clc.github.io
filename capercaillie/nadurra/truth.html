  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The words you wrote spilled like a poet's to the page
   <br/>
   Your eyes lit up as lovers met across a stage
   <br/>
   The warmth we saw in you came from deep within
   <br/>
   But the tenderness we cling to was a blanket for your pain
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The stars I gaze upon seem different since that day
   <br/>
   While one shines brighter, another fades away
   <br/>
   You light up the winter sky, the moon at your command
   <br/>
   Convinced you didn't mean it, your soul had different plans
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And this is truth calling, makes its way to me
   <br/>
   And this is love falling, falling at our feet
   <br/>
   She was your sister, your neighbor
   <br/>
   She was your daughter, your carer
   <br/>
   She was your mother, your sharer
   <br/>
   She was your friend, your lover
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Bowing heads of many hold your image in their minds
   <br/>
   The endless search for answers occupies the time
   <br/>
   Gazing at the pictures with eyes they fail to see
   <br/>
   Why in a moment, robbed of reason, you embraced eternity
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And this is truth calling, makes its way to me
   <br/>
   And this is love falling, falling at our feet
   <br/>
   Truth calling, makes its way to me
   <br/>
   And this is love falling, falling at our feet
  </p>

  </cleaned>
