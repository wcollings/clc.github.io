  <p align="center">
   Living in a place with time
   <br/>
   Living in a place where reality is
   <br/>
   Standing on a big broad line
   <br/>
   Watching it all go by
   <br/>
   Ah but you're taking it all away
   <br/>
   The music, the tongue and the old refrains
   <br/>
   You're coming here to play
   <br/>
   But you're pulling the roots from a dying age
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Remember the Buachaille Mor
   <br/>
   Reaching for the skies from the barren shores
   <br/>
   Watching over the village of burns
   <br/>
   And counting the days since the gael kept home
   <br/>
   Well, the stranger claims it now
   <br/>
   Sitting like a king with his gold from the south
   <br/>
   Don't you see the waves of wealth
   <br/>
   Washing away the soul from the land?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Here come the Clearances, my friend
   <br/>
   Silently our history is coming to life again
   <br/>
   We feel the breeze from the storm to come
   <br/>
   And up and down this coast
   <br/>
   We're waiting for the wheel to turn
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Free were the fields of fern
   <br/>
   Free was the fishing in the coves of care
   <br/>
   Empty are the homes of old
   <br/>
   Empty for the sake of summer's cause
   <br/>
   Yes, you're taking it all away
   <br/>
   The music, the tongue and the old refrains
   <br/>
   You're coming here to play
   <br/>
   But you're pulling the roots from a dying age
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Here come the Clearances, my friend
   <br/>
   Silently our history is coming to life again
   <br/>
   We feel the breeze from the storm to come
   <br/>
   And up and down this coast
   <br/>
   We're waiting for the wheel to turn
   <br/>
