   </b>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   From a window, a vision of your world
   <br/>
   Looks surreal in a blue and gray surround
   <br/>
   I'm here in a corner, a picture on your screen
   <br/>
   I'm a satellite beam, a bystander
   <br/>
   And I'm watching the ship going down
   <br/>
   With the deadliest cargo inbound
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Politicians, their axe is ground and clean
   <br/>
   Survey the scene in a well-rehearsed alarm
   <br/>
   Stand back from the shoreline with a silver dollar smile
   <br/>
   And you put us on file, leave an island
   <br/>
   To the curse of the spray and the spill
   <br/>
   Worse things happen at sea and they will
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   And how many birds make a sacrifice in the black fields?
   <br/>
   How many words 'til we pay the price in the black fields?
   <br/>
   I know disaster grows without looking twice in the black fields
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   All hands to the video, take a movie channel cruise
   <br/>
   Anything but news, all cocooned we climb the stairs
   <br/>
   Back here in the black fields, we hide behind the trees
   <br/>
   In chemical breeze, leave a call sign
   <br/>
   All the kings of the future will hear
   <br/>
   Civilization was here
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   To the world outside
   <br/>
   There was nothing more to see
   <br/>
   And the story died
   <br/>
   And the demon keeps below the sea
   <br/>
   And we cried and cried and cried
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   From a window, a vision of your world
   <br/>
   Looks surreal in a blue and gray surround
  </p>
