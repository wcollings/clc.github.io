  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Water lapping 'round my knees
   <br/>
   Golden sand beneath my feet
   <br/>
   Would mean a lot to me
   <br/>
   There's very little you can say
   <br/>
   To make those feelings go away
   <br/>
   'Til you take me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There's nothing more that I prefer
   <br/>
   To see the boys and the girls
   <br/>
   Step it out with grace and pride
   <br/>
   As honesty flows by their side
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I cannot run from times hard pressed
   <br/>
   To become embittered, dispossessed
   <br/>
   Just like some do
   <br/>
   And maybe some place I can find
   <br/>
   Where wheel and heart become entwined
   <br/>
   Like I hope to
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And nothing matters more to you
   <br/>
   To sit and sing a song that's true
   <br/>
   The first one there and last to leave
   <br/>
   Sweet memories for you to keep
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   No easy lesson for me to learn
   <br/>
   Just close those eyes of mock concern
   <br/>
   And halt your rush to be sincere
   <br/>
   There's more in life for you to fear
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There's nothing more that I prefer
   <br/>
   To see the boys and the girls
   <br/>
   Step it out with grace and pride
   <br/>
   As honesty flows by their side
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And nothing matters more to you
   <br/>
   To sit and sing a song that's true
   <br/>
   The first one there and last to leave
   <br/>
   Sweet memories for you to keep
