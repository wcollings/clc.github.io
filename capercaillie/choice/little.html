  <p align="center">
   Little do they know the things that you've been through
   <br/>
   A nation on its knees, begging for her soul
   <br/>
   And time and time again, your tears, they well and flow
   <br/>
   To the rivers of our home, is now the time to go?
   <br/>
   For little do they know
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   For years now we've been orphans in a storm
   <br/>
   Hanging on in vain for the clouds to unfold
   <br/>
   And time and time again, your tears, they well and flow
   <br/>
   Is this where I belong? Or is now the time to go?
   <br/>
   For little do they know
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There isn't a day goes by where I don't hope and pray
   <br/>
   There isn't a day goes by
   <br/>
   There isn't a day goes by where I don't hope and pray
   <br/>
   For change
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When all the world is calm with salvation at your door
   <br/>
   Those memories will fade and trouble you no more
   <br/>
   And I know how it feels when your tears, they well and flow
   <br/>
   Is this where I belong? Is now the time to go?
   <br/>
   For little do they know
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There isn't a day goes by where I don't hope and pray
   <br/>
   There isn't a day goes by
   <br/>
   There isn't a day goes by where I don't hope and pray
   <br/>
   For change
  </p>
