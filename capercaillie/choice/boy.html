  <p align="center">
   Consider waking here in the heart of all the troubles
   <br/>
   Where blood runs like wine
   <br/>
   In the rhythm of this city, man, he knows no pity
   <br/>
   Just live and work and die
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   There's the boy who sells his dreams to buy a little time
   <br/>
   He's the boy who sells his pearl-ragged dreams
   <br/>
   In a land that breaks your heart with its bullets and its guns
   <br/>
   In a land that breaks your pearl-ragged dreams
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh these, they are my people, and this is all I know
   <br/>
   The longer this goes on, my friend, the stronger I will grow
   <br/>
   Oh these, they are my people, and this is all I know
   <br/>
   The longer this goes on, my friend, the stronger I will grow
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   A raven circles high in a tapestry of blue
   <br/>
   Swirling 'round and 'round
   <br/>
   Its eyes glint like diamonds as if it knows the reasons
   <br/>
   Of something I should know
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And I would sell my dreams just to buy a little time
   <br/>
   Searching for the refuge of unknown
   <br/>
   'Cause this place would hold you down like a fever in your veins
   <br/>
   And you would sell your pearl-ragged dreams
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh these, they are my people, and this is all I know
   <br/>
   The longer this goes on, my friend, the stronger I will grow
   <br/>
   Oh these, they are my people, and this is all I know
   <br/>
   The longer this goes on, my friend, the stronger I will grow
  </p>
