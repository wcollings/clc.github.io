   </b>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When the smoke clears and the truth comes shining through
   <br/>
   I will watch the sparks fly from deadlines overdue
   <br/>
   And make no mistake now, time will hunt them down
   <br/>
   'Til the language of reason runs them to the ground
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   And who will raise their voice as the cruel winds blow?
   <br/>
   And who will call a truce? And who can break our fall?
   <br/>
   Whisper words of reason to those without a song
   <br/>
   And who will raise their voice and carry us along?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Those images are everywhere like sand in your hair
   <br/>
   From the beaches of childhood that slipped through your fingers
   <br/>
   They're like years of our lives, tormenting and cruel
   <br/>
   Will the world look this way again, silent and true?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So when the smoke clears and the truth comes shining through
   <br/>
   Those prophecies they made will crumble in two
   <br/>
   Like a dark horse riding, graceful through the night
   <br/>
   You're the language of reason, you're the language of life
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Who will raise their voice and carry us along?
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
