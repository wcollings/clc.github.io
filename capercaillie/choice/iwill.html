  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh I will set my ship in order
   <br/>
   I will sail her on the sea
   <br/>
   I'll go far over yonder border
   <br/>
   To see if my love minds on me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And he sailed east and he sailed west
   <br/>
   He sailed far, far seeking land
   <br/>
   Until he came to his true love's window
   <br/>
   And he knocked loud and would be in
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Oh who is that at my bedroom window?
   <br/>
   Who knocks so loud and would be in?"
   <br/>
   "'Tis I, 'tis I, your ain true lover
   <br/>
   And I am drenched untae my skin
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So go and go and ask your faither
   <br/>
   And see if he'll let you marry me
   <br/>
   If he says no, come back and tell me
   <br/>
   And it's the last time I'll trouble thee"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "My father's in his chamber writing
   <br/>
   Setting down his merchandise
   <br/>
   And in his hand he holds a letter
   <br/>
   And it speaks much in your dispraise
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   My mother's in her chamber sleeping
   <br/>
   And words of love she will not hear
   <br/>
   So you may go and court another
   <br/>
   And whisper softly in her ear"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Then she arose, put on her clothing
   <br/>
   It was to let her true love in
   <br/>
   But e're she had the door unlockit
   <br/>
   His ship was sailing on the main
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   "Come back, come back, my ain dear Johnny
   <br/>
   Come back, come back and marry me"
   <br/>
   "How can I come back and marry you, love?
   <br/>
   Our ship is sailing on the sea"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The fish may fly, and the seas run dry
   <br/>
   The rocks may melt doon wi' the sun
   <br/>
   And the working man may forget his labor
   <br/>
   Before that my love returns again
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She's turned herself right roun' about
   <br/>
   She's flung herself intae the sea
   <br/>
   Farewell for aye, my ain dear Johnny
   <br/>
   Ye'll ne'er hae tae come back to me
  </p>
