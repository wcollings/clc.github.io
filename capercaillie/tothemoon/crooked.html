  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The woman who read my palm today was a friend of the pessimistic
   <br/>
   In a square at the edge of town was my fortune laid to bear
   <br/>
   She said, "Climb that rocky mountain where the sun will rise to kiss you
   <br/>
   And your dreams will flow like a virgin spring to the foot of the crooked hill"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Feels good to be dreaming
   <br/>
   Feels good to be here with you
   <br/>
   Wait now, the mist will clear
   <br/>
   Wait now, the day will come
   <br/>
   I'm caught in the rain again
   <br/>
   I was caught on a snowbound highway
   <br/>
   I was caught in the rain again
   <br/>
   On top of the crooked mountain
   <br/>
   On top of the crooked mountain
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Like a fool, I took to the woman's words, being a slave of the optimistic
   <br/>
   I left my friends of childhood and the ones who saw me right
   <br/>
   Funny, you don't see the sunset and you wonder why you missed it
   <br/>
   For a year I saw the skies change 'til all the day was night
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Feels good to be dreaming
   <br/>
   Feels good to be here with you
   <br/>
   Feels good to be here
   <br/>
   Feels good to be dreaming
   <br/>
   Feels good to be here with you
   <br/>
   To be here
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   With the evening shadows falling on the day I'm supposed to find you
   <br/>
   Chances are I'll never realize
   <br/>
   The picture from this jigsaw that I always took for granted
   <br/>
   Now I'm caught here in a raging storm on top of the crooked hill
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus...)
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
