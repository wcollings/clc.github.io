  <p align="center">
   It rarely makes the news today
   <br/>
   The place where I was born
   <br/>
   They called it a wasteland
   <br/>
   A wilderness gone wrong
   <br/>
   Where the twisted trees have fallen
   <br/>
   The branches stripped and bare
   <br/>
   In the silence of the night time
   <br/>
   Innocence is here
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Beautiful wasteland is me
   <br/>
   Beautiful wasteland is me
   <br/>
   If only you'll see, you'll believe
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I embraced my father's warnings
   <br/>
   And studied in your schools
   <br/>
   To justify your theories
   <br/>
   And convoluted rules
   <br/>
   Travelled to the corners
   <br/>
   Where everybody knows
   <br/>
   My country's been wearing
   <br/>
   The emperor's clothes
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Beautiful wasteland is me
   <br/>
   Beautiful wasteland is me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I'll take you there
   <br/>
   To the bracken slopes
   <br/>
   When the summer's rolling in
   <br/>
   I'll take you there
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I'm lying by the ocean
   <br/>
   Her western breeze is still
   <br/>
   She's the heart of all seasons
   <br/>
   A mother to my soul
   <br/>
   When the century is over
   <br/>
   And the shipping days are done
   <br/>
   Like a child for the first time
   <br/>
   I'll lie here again
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Beautiful wasteland is me...
   <br/>
   If only you'll see, you'll believe...
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
 </body>
