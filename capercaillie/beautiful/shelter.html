  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We're building a shelter
   <br/>
   On the edge of mount Verona
   <br/>
   It's a corrugated palace
   <br/>
   With a tree-lined avenue
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   If you're frightened of the future
   <br/>
   And you're watching o'er your shoulder
   <br/>
   If you're getting kind of anxious and nervous
   <br/>
   Come and stay here 'til it's through
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   This ain't no ark of Noah
   <br/>
   No mockery of history
   <br/>
   A taxi ride to nowhere
   <br/>
   Just a drifting boat at sea
   <br/>
   (2x)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   My sister is working
   <br/>
   For every day pleasure
   <br/>
   The car in the driveway gleaming
   <br/>
   The kids watching MTV
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She was born to the Parish
   <br/>
   Says there's no way of leaving
   <br/>
   Says her rainbow is slowly fading, fading
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Just drifting and biding time
   <br/>
   Drifting, it's no crime
   <br/>
   Drifting, flying by
   <br/>
   Drifting
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We're building a shelter
   <br/>
   On the edge of mount Verona
   <br/>
   It's a corrugated palace and refuge
   <br/>
   With a tree-lined avenue
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Just drifting...
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
