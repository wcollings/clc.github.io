     Lyrics

   </b>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She stands at the window, proud Mary, bad news
   <br/>
   Demands, full credit, and the sheriff's men too
   <br/>
   The wife of a fisherman no longer at sea
   <br/>
   She can always find him where whiskey flows free
   <br/>
   She never called it poverty, the doorstep is clean
   <br/>
   'Til cityhall came calling to show what it means
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Have you seen it before?
   <br/>
   The names of good women and men
   <br/>
   Decreed by the sword and the pen
   <br/>
   To be outlaws all over again
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The names in the churchyard are long overgrown
   <br/>
   But still she comes kneeling with flowers of her own
   <br/>
   They're watching you, Mary, in hard times afraid
   <br/>
   As council finds guilty for charges unpaid
   <br/>
   And even as your last hope is labeled and sown
   <br/>
   We're all the one, Mary, outlawed for good
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And even as your last hope is labeled and sown
   <br/>
   We're all the one, Mary, outlawed for good
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus 2x)
  </p>
 </body>
