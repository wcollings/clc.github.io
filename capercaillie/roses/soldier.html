     Lyrics

   </b>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Marching once again under a myriad of stars
   <br/>
   Young men to the cause where all is fair in love and war
   <br/>
   But rules are rules, and no mercy can be shown
   <br/>
   In the fields of the departed where history is born
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   In all the lines and prose of war and its ways
   <br/>
   The words that speak the loudest are the ones that you would never say
   <br/>
   From Arras to the Somme and the hell of Passchendaele
   <br/>
   For ninety years and counting since you told your bloody tale
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Hey, soldier boy, is your conscience clear?
   <br/>
   Is your mind on the road from hell and back to the one you love so dear?
   <br/>
   I know you live in constant fear
   <br/>
   And that's just the way the world seems through roses and tears
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When the battle cries no more, and the martyr's work is done
   <br/>
   Did the voices in your head tell you to walk along the pathway
   <br/>
   Of the righteous and the good, and leave it all behind
   <br/>
   In the fields of the departed with the remnants of your mind?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Through roses and tears
   <br/>
   Through roses and tears
   <br/>
   Roses and tears
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So saddle up the horses and tighten up the reins
   <br/>
   Face the bitter winds of tyranny and shame
   <br/>
   We blind ourselves with grace and favors of the heart
   <br/>
   So our minds can hide away in the darkness of our past
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus 2x)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Roses and tears
  </p>
 </body>
