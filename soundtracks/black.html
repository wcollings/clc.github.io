     Lyrics

   </b>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   In a neat little town they call Belfast
   <br/>
   Apprenticed to trade I was bound
   <br/>
   Oh many an hour's sweet happiness
   <br/>
   Have I spent in that neat little town
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But a sad misfortune came over me
   <br/>
   Which caused me to stray from the land
   <br/>
   Far away from my friends and relations
   <br/>
   Betrayed by the black velvet band
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus (after each verse)
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Her eyes, they shone like diamonds
   <br/>
   I thought her the queen of the land
   <br/>
   And her hair, it hung over her shoulder
   <br/>
   Tied up with a black velvet band
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I took a stroll down Broadway
   <br/>
   Oh meaning not long for to stay
   <br/>
   When who should I meet but this pretty fair maid
   <br/>
   Come a-traipsing along the highway
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She was both fair and handsome
   <br/>
   Her neck, it was just like a swan's
   <br/>
   And her hair, it hung over her shoulder
   <br/>
   Tied up with a black velvet band
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So I took a stroll with this pretty fair maid
   <br/>
   And a gentleman, passing us by
   <br/>
   Oh I knew that she meant the undoing of him
   <br/>
   By the look in her roguish black eye
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   A gold watch she took from his pocket
   <br/>
   And slipped it right into my hand
   <br/>
   And the very first thing that I said was
   <br/>
   "Bad cess to the black velvet band"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Seven long years' penal servitude
   <br/>
   I spent down in Van Dieman's Land
   <br/>
   Far away from my friends and relations
   <br/>
   Betrayed by the black velvet band
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus 2x)
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
