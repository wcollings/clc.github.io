   Let me sail, let me sail, let the Orinoco flow
   <br/>
   Let me reach, let me beach on the shores of Tripoli
   <br/>
   Let me sail, let me sail, let me crash upon your shore
   <br/>
   Let me reach, let me beach far beyond the Yellow Sea
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Sail away, sail away, sail away
   <br/>
   Sail away, sail away, sail away
   <br/>
   Sail away, sail away, sail away
   <br/>
   Sail away, sail away, sail away
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   From Bissau to Palau, in the shade of Avalon
   <br/>
   From Fiji to Tiree and the Isles of Ebony
   <br/>
   From Peru to Cebu feel the power of Babylon
   <br/>
   From Bali to Cali, far beneath the Coral Sea
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Sail away, sail away, sail away
   <br/>
   Sail away, sail away, sail away
   <br/>
   Sail away, sail away, sail away
   <br/>
   Sail away, sail away, sail away
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   From the north to the south, Ebudæ into Khartoum
   <br/>
   From the deep Sea of Clouds to the Island of the Moon
   <br/>
   Carry me on the waves to the land I've never been
   <br/>
   Carry me on the waves to the lands I've never seen
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We can sail, we can sail with the Orinoco Flow
   <br/>
   We can sail, we can sail
   <br/>
   Sail away, sail away
   <br/>
   We can steer, we can near with Rob Dickens at the wheel
   <br/>
   We can sigh, say good-bye Ross and his dependencies
   <br/>
   We can sail, we can sail
   <br/>
   Sail away, sail away, sail away
   <br/>
   We can reach, we can beach on the shores of Tripoli
   <br/>
   We can sail, we can sail
   <br/>
   Sail away, sail away, sail away
   <br/>
   From Bali to Cali, far beneath the Coral Sea
   <br/>
   We can sail, we can sail
   <br/>
   Sail away, sail away, sail away
   <br/>
   We can sail, we can sail
   <br/>
   Sail away, sail away, sail away
   <br/>
   Sail away, sail away, sail away
   <br/>
   Sail away, sail away, sail away
  </p>
