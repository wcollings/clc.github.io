   Sing a new song to the world
   <br/>
   Let your voice be heard
   <br/>
   Go and bring the word
   <br/>
   This whole world was meant to be
   <br/>
   For you as well as me
   <br/>
   For humanity
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   We all travel the same road
   <br/>
   Carry the same load
   <br/>
   Reap what we have sowed
   <br/>
   You are hoping just like me
   <br/>
   To live with dignity
   <br/>
   Hoping to be free
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Sing out, sing out, sing to the world
   <br/>
   Sing out, you will be heard
   <br/>
   Sing the message and the word
   <br/>
   Sing a new song to the world
   <br/>
   Sing out, sing to the world
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   If your God's the same as mine
   <br/>
   Has been for all time
   <br/>
   Why are we so blind?
   <br/>
   What we're doing in His name
   <br/>
   Well, it's a crying shame
   <br/>
   We all cry the same
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Sing out, sing out, sing to the world
   <br/>
   Sing out, you will be heard
   <br/>
   Sing the message and the word
   <br/>
   Sing a new song to the world
   <br/>
   Sing out, sing to the world
   <br/>
