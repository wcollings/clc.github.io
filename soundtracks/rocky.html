   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    In the merry month of June, from me home I started
    <br/>
    Left the girls of Tuam nearly broken-hearted
    <br/>
    Saluted father dear, kissed me darlin' mother
    <br/>
    Drank a pint of beer me grief and tears to smother
    <br/>
    Then off to reap the corn, leave where I was born
    <br/>
    Cut a stout blackthorn to banish ghosts and goblins
    <br/>
    A brand new pair of brogues rattlin' o'er the bogs
    <br/>
    Frightenin' all the dogs on the rocky road to Dublin
   </font>

    <u>
     Chorus (after each verse)
    </u>
    :
    <br/>
    One two three four five
    <br/>
    Hunt the hare and turn her
    <br/>
    Down the rocky road
    <br/>
    All the way to Dublin
    <br/>
    Whack fol lol le rah

   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    In Mullingar that night I rested limbs so weary
    <br/>
    Started by daylight me spirits bright and airy
    <br/>
    Took a drop of the pure, keep me heart from sinkin'
    <br/>
    That's the Paddy's cure whenever he's on for drinkin'
    <br/>
    To see the lassies smile, laughin' all the while
    <br/>
    At me curious style 'twould set your heart a-bubblin'
    <br/>
    Asked if I was hired, wages I required
    <br/>
    'Til I was nearly tired of the rocky road to Dublin
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    In Dublin next arrived, I thought it such a pity
    <br/>
    To be so soon deprived a view of that fine city
    <br/>
    Well, then I took a stroll all among the quality
    <br/>
    Bundle, it was stole all in the neat locality
    <br/>
    Somethin' crossed me mind when I looked behind
    <br/>
    No bundle could I find upon me stick a-wobblin'
    <br/>
    Enquirin' for the rogue, said me Connacht brogue
    <br/>
    Wasn't much in vogue on the rocky road to Dublin
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    From there I got away, me spirits never failin'
    <br/>
    Landed on the quay just as the ship was sailin'
    <br/>
    The captain at me roared, said that no room had he
    <br/>
    When I jumped aboard, a cabin found for Paddy
    <br/>
    Down among the pigs, played some funny rigs
    <br/>
    Danced some hearty jigs, the water 'round me bubblin'
    <br/>
    When off Holyhead, wished meself was dead
    <br/>
    Or better far instead on the rocky road to Dublin
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    The boys of Liverpool when we safely landed
    <br/>
    Called meself a fool, I could no longer stand it
    <br/>
    Blood began to boil, temper I was losin'
    <br/>
    Poor old Erin's isle they began abusin'
    <br/>
    "Hurrah me soul," says I, my shillelagh I let fly
    <br/>
    Galway boys were nigh and saw I was a-hobblin'
    <br/>
    With a loud hurray, joined in the affray
    <br/>
    We quickly cleared the way for the rocky road to Dublin
   </font>

   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    Hunt the hare and turn her
    <br/>
    Down the rocky road

    All the way to Dublin
