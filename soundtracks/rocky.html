  </p>
  <p align="center">
   In the merry month of June, from me home I started
   <br/>
   Left the girls of Tuam nearly broken-hearted
   <br/>
   Saluted father dear, kissed me darlin' mother
   <br/>
   Drank a pint of beer me grief and tears to smother
   <br/>
   Then off to reap the corn, leave where I was born
   <br/>
   Cut a stout blackthorn to banish ghosts and goblins
   <br/>
   A brand new pair of brogues rattlin' o'er the bogs
   <br/>
   Frightenin' all the dogs on the rocky road to Dublin
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus (after each verse)
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   One two three four five
   <br/>
   Hunt the hare and turn her
   <br/>
   Down the rocky road
   <br/>
   All the way to Dublin
   <br/>
   Whack fol lol le rah
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   In Mullingar that night I rested limbs so weary
   <br/>
   Started by daylight me spirits bright and airy
   <br/>
   Took a drop of the pure, keep me heart from sinkin'
   <br/>
   That's the Paddy's cure whenever he's on for drinkin'
   <br/>
   To see the lassies smile, laughin' all the while
   <br/>
   At me curious style 'twould set your heart a-bubblin'
   <br/>
   Asked if I was hired, wages I required
   <br/>
   'Til I was nearly tired of the rocky road to Dublin
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   In Dublin next arrived, I thought it such a pity
   <br/>
   To be so soon deprived a view of that fine city
   <br/>
   Well, then I took a stroll all among the quality
   <br/>
   Bundle, it was stole all in the neat locality
   <br/>
   Somethin' crossed me mind when I looked behind
   <br/>
   No bundle could I find upon me stick a-wobblin'
   <br/>
   Enquirin' for the rogue, said me Connacht brogue
   <br/>
   Wasn't much in vogue on the rocky road to Dublin
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   From there I got away, me spirits never failin'
   <br/>
   Landed on the quay just as the ship was sailin'
   <br/>
   The captain at me roared, said that no room had he
   <br/>
   When I jumped aboard, a cabin found for Paddy
   <br/>
   Down among the pigs, played some funny rigs
   <br/>
   Danced some hearty jigs, the water 'round me bubblin'
   <br/>
   When off Holyhead, wished meself was dead
   <br/>
   Or better far instead on the rocky road to Dublin
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The boys of Liverpool when we safely landed
   <br/>
   Called meself a fool, I could no longer stand it
   <br/>
   Blood began to boil, temper I was losin'
   <br/>
   Poor old Erin's isle they began abusin'
   <br/>
   "Hurrah me soul," says I, my shillelagh I let fly
   <br/>
   Galway boys were nigh and saw I was a-hobblin'
   <br/>
   With a loud hurray, joined in the affray
   <br/>
   We quickly cleared the way for the rocky road to Dublin
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Hunt the hare and turn her
   <br/>
   Down the rocky road
   <br/>
   All the way to Dublin
   <br/>
   Whack fol lol le rah
   <br/>
   Whack fol lol le rah
   <br/>
   Whack fol lol le rah
  </p>
