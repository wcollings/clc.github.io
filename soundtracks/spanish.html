  <p align="center">
   As I came down through Dublin City
   <br/>
   At the hour of twelve at night
   <br/>
   Who should I see but the Spanish lady
   <br/>
   Washing her feet by candlelight
   <br/>
   First she washed them, then she dried them
   <br/>
   Over a fire of amber coal
   <br/>
   In all my life I ne'er did see
   <br/>
   A maid so sweet about the sole
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Whack for the toora loora laddy
   <br/>
   Whack for the toora loora lay
   <br/>
   Whack for the toora loora laddy
   <br/>
   Whack for the toora loora lay
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   As I came back through Dublin City
   <br/>
   At the hour of half past eight
   <br/>
   Who should I spy but the Spanish lady
   <br/>
   Brushing her hair in the broad daylight
   <br/>
   First she tossed it, then she brushed it
   <br/>
   On her lap was a silver comb
   <br/>
   In all my life I ne'er did see
   <br/>
   A maid so fair since I did roam
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   As I went back through Dublin City
   <br/>
   As the sun began to set
   <br/>
   Who should I spy but the Spanish lady
   <br/>
   Catching a moth in a golden net
   <br/>
   When she saw me, then she fled me
   <br/>
   Lifting her petticoat over her knee
   <br/>
   In all my life I ne'er did see
   <br/>
   A maid so shy as the Spanish lady
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus...)
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
