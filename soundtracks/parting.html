  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Of all the money that e'er I had
   <br/>
   I spent it in good company
   <br/>
   And all the harm I've ever done
   <br/>
   Alas, it was to none but me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And all I've done for want of wit
   <br/>
   To memory now I can't recall
   <br/>
   So fill to me the parting glass
   <br/>
   Good night and joy be to you all
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   So fill to me the parting glass
   <br/>
   And drink a health whate'er befalls
   <br/>
   Then gently rise and softly call
   <br/>
   "Good night and joy be to you all"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Of all the comrades that e'er I had
   <br/>
   They're sorry for my going away
   <br/>
   And all the sweethearts that e'er I had
   <br/>
   They'd wish me one more day to stay
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But since it fell into my lot
   <br/>
   That I should rise and you should not
   <br/>
   I'll gently rise and softly call
   <br/>
   "Good night and joy be to you all"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But since it fell into my lot
   <br/>
   That I should rise and you should not
   <br/>
   I'll gently rise and softly call
   <br/>
   "Good night and joy be to you all"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Good night and joy be to you all
  </p>

  </cleaned>
