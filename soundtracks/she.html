  <p align="center">
   My young love said to me, "My mother won't mind
   <br/>
   And my father won't slight you for your lack of kind"
   <br/>
   And she stepped away from me and this she did say
   <br/>
   "It will not be long, love, 'til our wedding day"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She stepped away from me and she moved through the fair
   <br/>
   And fondly I watched her move here and move there
   <br/>
   And she made her way homeward with one star awake
   <br/>
   As the swan in the evening moves over the lake
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Last night she came to me, she came softly in
   <br/>
   So softly she came that her feet made no din
   <br/>
   And she laid her hand on me and this she did say
   <br/>
   "It will not be long, love, 'til our wedding day"
  </p>
