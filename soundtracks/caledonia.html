  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I don't know if you can see
   <br/>
   The changes that have come over me
   <br/>
   In these last few days I've been afraid
   <br/>
   That I might drift away
   <br/>
   I've been telling old stories, singing songs
   <br/>
   That make me think about where I've come from
   <br/>
   That's the reason why I seem
   <br/>
   So far away today
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   Let me tell you that I love you
   <br/>
   That I think about you all the time
   <br/>
   Caledonia, you're calling me, now I'm going home
   <br/>
   But if I should become a stranger
   <br/>
   Know that it would make me more than sad
   <br/>
   Caledonia's been everything I've ever had
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Now I have moved and I've kept on moving
   <br/>
   Proved the points that I needed proving
   <br/>
   Lost the friends that I needed losing
   <br/>
   Found others on the way
   <br/>
   I have kissed the fellas and left them crying
   <br/>
   Stolen dreams, yes, there's no denying
   <br/>
   I have traveled hard, sometimes with conscience flying
   <br/>
   Somewhere with the wind
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Now I'm sitting here before the fire
   <br/>
   The empty room, the forest choir
   <br/>
   The flames have cooled, don't get any higher
   <br/>
   They've withered, now they've gone
   <br/>
   But I'm steady thinking, my way is clear
   <br/>
   And I know what I will do tomorrow
   <br/>
   When hands have shaken, the kisses float
   <br/>
   Then I will disappear
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Caledonia's been everything I've ever had
   <br/>
   Caledonia's been everything I've ever had
   <br/>
   Caledonia's been everything I've ever had
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
