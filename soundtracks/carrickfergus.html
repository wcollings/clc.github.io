  <p align="center">
   I wish I was in Carrickfergus
   <br/>
   Where the castle looks out to sea
   <br/>
   I would swim over the deepest ocean
   <br/>
   For my love to be with me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But the sea is wide and I cannot swim over
   <br/>
   Nor have I the wings for to fly
   <br/>
   I wish I had a handsome boatsman
   <br/>
   To ferry me over, my love and I
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I wish I was in the land of Erin
   <br/>
   Where the mountains meet the sea
   <br/>
   Where flowers blossom as I do remember
   <br/>
   Where my true love came to me
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   But the sea is wide and I cannot swim over
   <br/>
   Nor have I the wings for to fly
   <br/>
   Ah to be back now in Carrickfergus
   <br/>
   To be together, my love and I
   <br/>
   To be together, my love and I
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I wish I was in Carrickfergus
   <br/>
   I wish I was in Carrickfergus
   <br/>
   I wish I was back home again
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
