  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Tonight we're going to meet some lads
   <br/>
   Us girls are dressed up gaily
   <br/>
   And we'll be dancing 'til the dawn
   <br/>
   We're going to the c&eacute;ili
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The lads, they come from miles around
   <br/>
   From Ennis and Kilmaley
   <br/>
   To show us all their fancy steps
   <br/>
   We're going to the c&eacute;ili
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   They're playing tunes and everything
   <br/>
   From pipes to ukulele
   <br/>
   It sounds so good, you can't sit down
   <br/>
   We're dancing at the c&eacute;ili
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   All the boys we loved so well
   <br/>
   So handsome, young and charming
   <br/>
   They're in New York and Boston now
   <br/>
   They should be home here farming
   <br/>
   My own true love has sailed away
   <br/>
   To be an endless rover
   <br/>
   'Cause times are tough, and he must leave
   <br/>
   To start a new life over
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He writes me letters every week
   <br/>
   To say how much he's slaving
   <br/>
   And he promises that he'll be back
   <br/>
   Before the hay needs saving
   <br/>
   But it's hard to love somebody
   <br/>
   That you're not in touch with daily
   <br/>
   So I'm looking for somebody new
   <br/>
   Tonight down at the c&eacute;ili
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The winter nights are long and hard
   <br/>
   And time goes by so slowly
   <br/>
   I wish my true love, he was here
   <br/>
   And in his arms I'd roll
   <br/>
   He'd whisper tender words of love to me
   <br/>
   And kiss my lips so sweetly
   <br/>
   And quickly I'd surrender to
   <br/>
   His manly charms completely
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   He writes me letters every week
   <br/>
   To say how much he's slaving
   <br/>
   And he promises that he'll be back
   <br/>
   Before the hay needs saving
   <br/>
   But it's hard to love somebody
   <br/>
   That you're not in touch with daily
   <br/>
   So I'm looking for somebody new
   <br/>
   Tonight down at the c&eacute;ili
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   So I'm looking for somebody new
   <br/>
   Tonight down at the c&eacute;ili
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I hope I meet someone tonight
   <br/>
   Who'll make my heart beat fast
   <br/>
   A handsome man with laughing eyes
   <br/>
   Who smiles as he walks past
   <br/>
   And when the play an old-time waltz
   <br/>
   He'll twirl me 'round the floor
   <br/>
   And promise me that I will be
   <br/>
   His girl forevermore
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   His girl forevermore
   <br/>
   His girl forevermore
   <br/>
   Who'll promise me that I will be
   <br/>
   His girl forevermore
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I'm somewhat in a bother
   <br/>
   That is really quite alarming
   <br/>
   I have two lads pursuing me
   <br/>
   And each of them is charming
   <br/>
   One of them is dark and poor
   <br/>
   One fair with lots of money
   <br/>
   I don't know which one to choose
   <br/>
   The flower or the honey
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   What on earth am I to do?
   <br/>
   It's driving me half crazy
   <br/>
   Tonight I'll make my mind up
   <br/>
   When I see them at the c&eacute;ili
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   To be a poor man's wife
   <br/>
   Will be a life of washing dishes
   <br/>
   While a rich man's wife will surely have
   <br/>
   Great luxury and riches
   <br/>
   In comfort how I know
   <br/>
   It wouldn't be too hard to wallow
   <br/>
   And being poor is not much fun
   <br/>
   Which one should I follow?
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   What on earth am I to do?
   <br/>
   It's driving me half crazy
   <br/>
   Tonight I'll make my mind up
   <br/>
   When I see them at the c&eacute;ili
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I've been lucky, I've found a lad
   <br/>
   Who's handsome and a neighbor
   <br/>
   And me, I've met a decent man
   <br/>
   Whose friendship I will savor
   <br/>
   And me, I made my choice as well
   <br/>
   And in no way was it easy
   <br/>
   But I'd rather have a man for love
   <br/>
   Than be a rich man's lady
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   And that is how the story ends
   <br/>
   May true love never fail me
   <br/>
   We got ourselves three men tonight
   <br/>
   And we met them at the c&eacute;ili
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
