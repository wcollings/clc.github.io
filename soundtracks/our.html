     Lyrics

  <p align="center">
   I once had a true love and I loved him so well
   <br/>
   I loved him far better than my tongue can tell
   <br/>
   And I thought that he spoke and to me did say
   <br/>
   "It will not be long, love, 'til our wedding day"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   If I were an eagle and had wings for to fly
   <br/>
   I would fly to his castle and there I would lie
   <br/>
   On a bed of green laurel I would lay myself down
   <br/>
   And with my fond dreams I would my love surround
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I dreamt last night that my true love came in
   <br/>
   So slowly he came that his feet made no din
   <br/>
   And I thought that he spoke and to me did say
   <br/>
   "It will not be long, love, 'til our wedding day"
  </p>
