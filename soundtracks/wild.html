   <br/>
   And it's no, nay, never
   <br/>
   No, nay, never, no more
   <br/>
   Will I play the wild rover
   <br/>
   No, never, no more
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I've been a wild rover for many's a year
   <br/>
   And I've spent all me money on whiskey and beer
   <br/>
   And now I'm returning with gold in great store
   <br/>
   And I never will play the wild rover no more
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I went into an alehouse I used to frequent
   <br/>
   And I told the landlady my money was spent
   <br/>
   I asked her for credit, she answered me nay
   <br/>
   "Such a custom as yours I could have any day"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Then out of my pocket I took sovereigns bright
   <br/>
   And the landlady's eyes opened wide with delight
   <br/>
   She said, "I have whiskey and wines of the best
   <br/>
   And the words that I spoke, they were only in jest"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I'll go home to my parents, confess what I've done
   <br/>
   And I'll ask them to pardon their prodigal son
   <br/>
   And if they caress me as oft times before
   <br/>
   I never will play the wild rover no more
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus 3x)
  </p>
  <cleaned>
  </cleaned>
