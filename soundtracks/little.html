  <p align="center">
   I am a little beggarman, a-begging I have been
   <br/>
   For three score or more in this little isle of green
   <br/>
   I'm known from the Liffey down to Segue
   <br/>
   And I'm known by the name of old Johnny Dhu
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Of all the trades that's going, I'm sure begging is the best
   <br/>
   For when a man is tired, he can sit down and rest
   <br/>
   He can beg for his dinner, he has nothing else to do
   <br/>
   Only cut around the corner with his old rig-a-doo
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I slept in the barn right down at Caurabawn
   <br/>
   A wet night came on and I slept until the dawn
   <br/>
   With holes in the roof and the rain coming through
   <br/>
   And the rats and the cats, they were playing peek-a-boo
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   When who did I waken but the woman of the house
   <br/>
   With her white spotty apron and her calico blouse
   <br/>
   She began to frighten, I said, "Boo
   <br/>
   Ara, don't be afraid, ma'am, it's only Johnny Dhu"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I met a little flaxy-haired girl one day
   <br/>
   "Good morning, little flaxy-haired girl," I did say
   <br/>
   "Good morning, little beggarman, and how do you do
   <br/>
   With your rags and your tags and your old rig-a-doo?"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I'll buy a pair of leggings and a collar and a tie
   <br/>
   And a nice young lady I'll fetch by and by
   <br/>
   I'll buy a pair of goggles, I'll color them blue
   <br/>
   And an old-fashioned lady I will make her, too
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Over the road with me pack on me back
   <br/>
   Over the fields with me great, heavy sack
   <br/>
   With holes in me shoes and me toes peeping through
   <br/>
   Singing, "Skinny-me-rink-a-doodle-o and old Johnny Dhu"
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I must be going to bed for it's getting late at night
   <br/>
   The fire's all raked and out goes the light
   <br/>
   So now you've heard the story of me old rig-a-doo
   <br/>
   "It's good-bye and God be with you," says old Johnny Dhu
  </p>

  </cleaned>
