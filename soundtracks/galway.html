   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    Oh she dressed in the dark and she whispered, "Amen"
    <br/>
    She was pretty in pink like a young girl again
    <br/>
    Twenty years married and she never thought twice
    <br/>
    She slipped out of the back door and into the night
    <br/>
    And silver wings carried her over the sea
    <br/>
    From the west coast of Ireland to west Tennessee
    <br/>
    To be with her sweetheart she left everything
    <br/>
    She went from Galway to Graceland to be with the king
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    She was humming "Suspicion", the song she loved best
    <br/>
    She had "Elvis, I love you" tattooed on her breast
    <br/>
    When they landed in Memphis her heart beat so fast
    <br/>
    She had dreamed for so long, now she'd see him at last
    <br/>
    And she knelt by his graveside day after day
    <br/>
    And come closing time they would pull her away
    <br/>
    To be with her sweetheart, she left everything
    <br/>
    She went from Galway to Graceland to be with the king
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">
    In their thousands they came from the whole human race
    <br/>
    Just to pay their respects at his last resting place
    <br/>
    But blindly she knelt there and she told him her dreams
    <br/>
    And she thought that he answered her, or that's how it seemed
    <br/>
    And when they dragged her away, it was handcuffs this time
    <br/>
    She said, "My dear man, are you out of your mind?
    <br/>
    Don't you know that we're married? See, I'm wearing his ring?
    <br/>
    I've come from Galway to Graceland to be with the king
    <br/>
    I've come from Galway to Graceland to be with the king"
