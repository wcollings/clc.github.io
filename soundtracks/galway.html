  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Oh she dressed in the dark and she whispered, "Amen"
   <br/>
   She was pretty in pink like a young girl again
   <br/>
   Twenty years married and she never thought twice
   <br/>
   She slipped out of the back door and into the night
   <br/>
   And silver wings carried her over the sea
   <br/>
   From the west coast of Ireland to west Tennessee
   <br/>
   To be with her sweetheart she left everything
   <br/>
   She went from Galway to Graceland to be with the king
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   She was humming "Suspicion", the song she loved best
   <br/>
   She had "Elvis, I love you" tattooed on her breast
   <br/>
   When they landed in Memphis her heart beat so fast
   <br/>
   She had dreamed for so long, now she'd see him at last
   <br/>
   And she knelt by his graveside day after day
   <br/>
   And come closing time they would pull her away
   <br/>
   To be with her sweetheart, she left everything
   <br/>
   She went from Galway to Graceland to be with the king
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   In their thousands they came from the whole human race
   <br/>
   Just to pay their respects at his last resting place
   <br/>
   But blindly she knelt there and she told him her dreams
   <br/>
   And she thought that he answered her, or that's how it seemed
   <br/>
   And when they dragged her away, it was handcuffs this time
   <br/>
   She said, "My dear man, are you out of your mind?
   <br/>
   Don't you know that we're married? See, I'm wearing his ring?
   <br/>
   I've come from Galway to Graceland to be with the king
   <br/>
   I've come from Galway to Graceland to be with the king"
