<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
Oh she dressed in the dark and she whispered, "Amen"<br>
She was pretty in pink like a young girl again<br>
Twenty years married and she never thought twice<br>
She slipped out of the back door and into the night<br>
And silver wings carried her over the sea<br>
From the west coast of Ireland to west Tennessee<br>
To be with her sweetheart she left everything<br>
She went from Galway to Graceland to be with the king</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
She was humming "Suspicion", the song she loved best<br>
She had "Elvis, I love you" tattooed on her breast<br>
When they landed in Memphis her heart beat so fast<br>
She had dreamed for so long, now she'd see him at last<br>
And she knelt by his graveside day after day<br>
And come closing time they would pull her away<br>
To be with her sweetheart, she left everything<br>
She went from Galway to Graceland to be with the king</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Book Antiqua">
In their thousands they came from the whole human race<br>
Just to pay their respects at his last resting place<br>
But blindly she knelt there and she told him her dreams<br>
And she thought that he answered her, or that's how it seemed<br>
And when they dragged her away, it was handcuffs this time<br>
She said, "My dear man, are you out of your mind?<br>
Don't you know that we're married? See, I'm wearing his ring?<br>
I've come from Galway to Graceland to be with the king<br>
I've come from Galway to Graceland to be with the king"</font></p></body>
