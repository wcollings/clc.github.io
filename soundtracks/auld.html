  <p align="center">
   A hungry feeling came o'er me stealing
   <br/>
   And the mice were squealing in my prison cell
   <br/>
   And the old triangle went jingle jangle
   <br/>
   All along the banks of the royal canal
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   To begin the morning the screw was bawling
   <br/>
   "Get up, ya bowsie, and clean up your cell"
   <br/>
   And the old triangle went jingle jangle
   <br/>
   All along the banks of the royal canal
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   The screw was peeping, Humpy Gussy was sleeping
   <br/>
   As I lay there dreaming of my girl, Sal
   <br/>
   And the old triangle went jingle jangle
   <br/>
   All along the banks of the royal canal
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Up in the female prison there are seventy-five women
   <br/>
   And 'tis among them I wish I did dwell
   <br/>
   Then the old triangle could go jingle jangle
   <br/>
   All along the banks of the royal canal
   <br/>
   All along the banks of the royal canal
  </p>
