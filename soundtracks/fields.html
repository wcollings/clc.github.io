     Lyrics

  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I was born in a country where people admire
   <br/>
   Their great sporting heroes and how they aspire
   <br/>
   To stand upon mountains and always be winners
   <br/>
   And never give less than their all
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I once met an old man who told me great stories
   <br/>
   Of legends of old who played hard for the glory
   <br/>
   Of lifting the cup in that moment of triumph
   <br/>
   These memories kept me enthralled
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <u>
    Chorus
   </u>
   :
   <br/>
   On the fields, the fields of glory
   <br/>
   On the fields where boys become men
   <br/>
   On the fields, the fields of glory
   <br/>
   May the best team win, win in the end
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   Supporting their team with a true sense of place
   <br/>
   Are the handfuls of people with pride on their faces
   <br/>
   They come from the townlands, the parrish, the village
   <br/>
   Their banners they proudly unfurl
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   An anthem of hope is the song they are singing
   <br/>
   The whistle, it sounds and the game, it begins
   <br/>
   And the roar of the crowd echoes up to the heavens
   <br/>
   It sends out a clarion call
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I'm dreaming of Ireland in fine summer weather
   <br/>
   A crowd of young lads playing football together
   <br/>
   All hoping that someday the call they will answer
   <br/>
   To play for the place they were born
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   (Chorus)
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   I'm dreaming of Ireland in fine summer weather
   <br/>
   A crowd of young lads playing football together
   <br/>
   The roar of the crowd echoes up to the heavens
   <br/>
   It sends out a clarion call
  </p>
